0,1.html,"(Q1, 2015)","Actions Semiconductor Co., Ltd.",CEO,False,ACTS,Zhenyu Zhou,"[Thank you for participating in Actions earning conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in the company. I will provide an overview of our performance in the first quarter of 2015, along with some operational updates. Later on the call, Nigel Liu, CFO, will discuss financial results for the quarter., Quarter summary; revenue for the quarter was $10.5 million, coming in at the midrange of our expectations and down from $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Overall, demand was slow primarily due to the Chinese New Year holiday, which caused a seasonal slowdown in production by consumer electronics manufacturers in China in the first quarter of the year as expected, and softer demand for tablets as the worldwide tablet market experienced a year-over-year decline in shipments for the second consecutive quarter., Our multimedia business exceeded expectations with strong demand for our Bluetooth 4.0 solutions for speakers and boomboxes and an abatement in the supply shortage from our wafer foundry. Overall, it was expected that the first quarter would be the slowest quarter of the year., Gross margin was 23.5%, up from a negative 19.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.1% in the first quarter of 2014. In the second half of 2014, we wrote down certain lower margin, slower moving inventory in accordance with our accounting policies. We were able to sell a portion of this inventory and recovered some of these expenses in the first quarter of 2015., Although gross margin improved, it continues to be impacted by the fierce competition in the tablet market, which accounts for the largest portion of our application processor shipments today., Net loss attributable to Actions was $5.0 million or $0.085 per basic and diluted ADS compared to net loss attributable to Actions of $5.5 million or $0.08 per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2014., We entered 2015 armed with a portfolio of leading edge new products that are currently in the early adoption and designing stage. We expect these new products to support revenue growth of 20% to 25% and good margin improvement in the year ahead. Moreover, because we incurred the expense related to these products in 2014, we expect R&D expense in 2015 to be below 2014’s level., Now I will provide some details about our multimedia business and application processor business, cloud connected device. Multimedia business; our multimedia business exceeded expectations in the first quarter of 2015 led by our Bluetooth 4.0 solutions for speakers and boomboxes., The supply shortage of wafers from our foundry has abated and we do not foresee any meaningful impact in the coming quarters. We prepared delivery samples of our new single chip Bluetooth 4.0 SoC for boomboxes, speakers, headphones and related products, the ATS282X during the first quarter and are seeing the steep lift in volume. We expect that ATS282X along with our other Bluetooth 4.0 SoC for soundbars, LED [indiscernible] and audio systems to be the driving force in our multimedia business in 2015., The Bluetooth audio and the music market provides enormous growth potential. From recent research reports from IHS forecast Bluetooth-enabled consumer electronics shipment will grow at a five-year CAGR of 20% reaching 1.4 billion units in 2018 and that more than half of all consumer electronics devices shipped in 2018 will be Bluetooth enabled., We believe our investment in the Bluetooth audio and music market will position us to capitalize in a much bigger and emerging market opportunities for the Internet of Things, IoT that is smart hardware., Application processor business; during the first quarter of 2015, shipments from application processor business came in slightly below our expectations and declined from the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to the seasonality related to the Chinese New Year holiday and softer demand in the worldwide tablet market., Tablet SoC, which account for the largest proportion of application processor shipments today, continue facing a difficult competitive environment. In addition, demand for tablets has slowed considerably than demand for WiFi-only tablets is shrinking as a result of competitive pressure from tablets with cellular connectivity and large screen smartphones., On the other hand, OTT set-top box solutions are making an increasing contribution to our revenue mix at more favorable selling prices, and our products gained additional design wins with brand named customers in the quarter. We believe China’s OTT set-top box market has strong growth potential and we expect to have additional shares in the year ahead. However, this market is still evolving and it may face policy changes and restrictions from the PRC government that could limit the upside., Over the last year, we have focused on expanding our application processor business beyond tablets to focus on other new and profitable growth market segments. Our product portfolio now addresses OTT set-top boxes and other clouds connected devices, including but not limited to Netbooks, advertising machines, POS machines, and smart micro projectors., Most of our new chipsets based on 28-nanometer process technology announced last year and early this year are gaining good traction. Our 32-bit quad-core SoC solution targets the low to net tier of the application processor market and offers a very attractive performance and compelling good [ph] cost., We began shipping small volumes in the first quarter to the tablet, OTT and other cloud connected device market segments and we expect the shipments to ramp quickly starting in the second quarter. We believe the new 28-nanometer and 32-bit based quad-core SoC will be a large revenue driver in our application processor business in 2015., Our high performance 64-bit SoC with various market application is currently in the design win space. The 64-bit based application processor is an ultra high performance quad-core solution offering an exceptional user experience, low power consumption and a diversity in applications., The 64-bit era for smartphones, tablets and other cloud connected devices has started. And the 64-bit application processors are quickly becoming the industry standard. We expect the 64-bit application processor to quickly seize the meaningful design wins and to make a meaningful contribution to revenue as well as gross profits in the second quarter of 2015., Now also supporting the open-source intelligent hardware community for Android and Linux, we’ve launched a 32-bit S500 and 64-bit S900 open-source SoC and reference design platforms. We are the founding member of Linaro’s 96Boards initiatives where our 64-bit S900 SoC and ActDuino S900 reference design platform offer developers a very high performance and diversified developed platform as well as the best technology access for the latest 64-bit ARM architecture., We believe our new offering will generate strong interest from developers for all types of cloud connected products from branded tablets and OTT set-top boxes to smartphones. We believe our compelling portfolio of leading edge products for tablet, OTT set-top boxes and other cloud connected devices will deliver higher selling prices and more favorable margins. We believe our overall application processor business will return to a healthy track by mid-2015., Business update summary; we entered the year armed with a portfolio of leading edge products targeting a wide range of markets that we expect to support revenue growth of 20% to 25% and good margin improvement in 2015. Our Bluetooth 4.0 solution led by our single chip solutions for boomboxes, speakers and the related products will be the driving force in our multimedia business this year., Although we expect the tepid markets to remain challenging, our application processor business should return to a healthy track by mid-2015 supported by our new 32-bit and 64-bit solutions. We expect a steady growth from the OTT set-top box markets and a strong profit contribution from differentiated new products for other cloud connected devices based on our open platform SoC and reference design platforms. As revenue and margins improve in 2015, we will focus on cost control with the goal of reducing research and development expenses from 2014 levels., Before I turn the call over to Nigel to discuss our financial results, I’d like to briefly comment on a few items. The first matter concerns an ongoing dialogue with an investor who reports to be our largest shareholder. This shareholder has indicated through an open letter to our Board of Directors a number of objections regarding our corporate governance along with his intention of taking legal action against the company and his efforts to gain control of the company., On Friday, May 8, the company responded to the various allegations made in the open letter in a press release, which is available on our Web site and filed with the SEC on Form 6-K. Earlier today, we held our annual general meeting of shareholders whereby our shareholders voted in favor of all measures on the ballot including the reelection of Mr. David Lee and Mr. Casper Lin as directors. We thank all of our shareholders for their continued support of the company during the past year., Now I’d like to turn the call over to Nigel Liu, our CFO, who will review our financial results for the first quarter., Thank you for joining us on today’s earnings call. As disclosed in our earnings press release issued earlier today, we will not be conducting a question-and-answer session on today’s call. However, we continue to welcome written questions and comments from our shareholders., We will also be providing more detailed information about our financial performance and future prospects in our quarterly earnings press releases and our prepared remarks in the future. We appreciate your interest in and continuous support of Actions. Thank you.]",[],1543,0,1543

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, we recorded revenue of $10.5 million compared to $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2014., Our gross margin for the first quarter was 23.5% compared to negative 19.2% for the prior quarter. As Dr. Zhou mentioned, gross margin in the first quarter of 2015 benefited from sales of certain lower-margin, slower moving inventories which were written-down in the second half of 2014 with a net impact of 0.8 million., For the first quarter, total stock-based compensation expenses were $5,000 compared to $29,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014. R&D expenses were $6.8 million for the first quarter compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014., G&A expenses were $2 million in the first quarter compared to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to normal seasonal fluctuations. Sales and marketing expenses were $0.6 million in the first quarter compared to $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014., Impairment on intangible assets was nil in the first quarter compared to 0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 [indiscernible] reorganization of our corporate structure. Operating loss was $13 million for the first quarter compared to an operating loss of $13.3 million for the prior quarter., Net income for the first quarter was 15,000 compared to net loss of 1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The loss in the prior quarter was primarily due to a decline in the RMB related to the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2014. Interest income was $1.6 million for the first quarter compared to 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014., Last, deferred tax was $5.5 million for the first quarter compared to a loss before tax of $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Income tax credit was $0.5 million for the first quarter, similar to an income tax credit of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014., Net loss attributable to Actions Semiconductor on a U.S. GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2015 was $5 million or $0.085 per basic and diluted ADS. This compares to a net loss of $12.2 million or $0.206 per basic and diluted ADS for the fourth quarter of 2014., Now moving to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents together with the time deposits, trading securities and both current and non-current marketable securities totaled $152.4 million as of March 31, 2015 compared to $158.2 million as of December 31, 2014. Of the $152.4 million total, $119.3 million was in cash with a short-term interest period investments together with time deposits that was generally issued by large domestic bank in China for terms no more than three months and can be redeemed at any time., $43.1 million was in trading securities and the marketable securities, which were principle of guarantees of pledged investment with high interest rate and the minimal returns of three months, less marketable securities while many issues manage or guaranteed by top ranking state owned financial institutions in China., Our short-term borrowing totaled $45 million at the end of the first quarter unchanged from December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable was $3.4 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015 compared to $4.5 million at the end of 2014., Accounts receivables includes amount due from a related target and equity method investees. Inventory was $15 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $14 million at the end of the prior quarter., We continue to buy back shares, spending approximately $0.6 million during the first quarter. As of March 31, 2015, the company had invest a total of $18 million in the program, representing the equivalent of 24.3 million ADS, included 25 million or the equivalent of 10 million ADS as part of our Dutch auction tender offer in September 2014., Now, turning to our outlook. Based on current market trends, we expect revenue in the second quarter of 2015 to be in the range of $13 million to $14 million. We expect our newly launched products to gain rating in the upcoming quarter and accelerate in the second half of 2015., Now, I will turn back the call to Dr. Zhou.]",[],648,0,648

1,10.html,"(Q1, 2015)","Cancer Genetics, Inc.",President and CEO,True,CGIX,Panna Sharma,"[Thank you Brian. Good morning to all of you today on the call. Thank you for joining us and taking the time to listen and participate in our first quarter 2015 conference call. For 2015, we're off to a very strong start this year and I am pleased to have the opportunity to take you through some of our operational and financial results for the first quarter., The momentum that our business gained in 2014 is continuing to accelerate as we build progress in 2015. The investments that we've made in our genomic portfolio and our acquisitions and our world class collaborations are generating strong results and an increase in our market share and we also making an overall positive impact in the oncology industry and oncology patients., This morning we will update you on our financial results for the first quarter and also on how we're successfully executing on strategic initiatives we laid out on our year end call in March. Following this we'll turn it over to questions and answers., You've heard me say before Cancer Genetics is an emerging leader in providing critical genomic and biomarker information for the personalization of oncology treatment. We offer our proprietary, disease focused and clinical validated genomic tests and services to clinical centers, hospitals, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and research organizations. We have a unique and unparalleled global infrastructure for the development and delivery of oncology diagnostics from bench to bed side through our four state-of-the-art facilities in New Jersey, North Carolina, India and China., Our research collaborations with 18 leading academic and research centers, including Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering, The National Cancer Institute, Columbia University, Moffitt Cancer Center and Beth Israel, among many others allows us to access innovation in oncology and genomics, rapidly validates our insights and tests and have unique access to translational oncology programs. We think these collaborations are a true stamp of differentiation and an element of our long term durability as a company., An excellent example of this is our most recent research collaboration with the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. A series of collaborative studies where diagnostic researcher doctors Heather Jim, Diane Portman, Hailey McCloud and Gillian Bell [ph] will examine a number of genetic variance as predictors for the most common side effects associated with chemotherapy treatment which continues to be one of the most broadly used treatments in cancer., Our second collaboration will examine the world of individual genetic variance and effectiveness of pain control in cancer. Results from this partnership and with other leading cancer research organizations will help guide the development of treatment options and provide critical and validated genomic information that improves patient management and reduces healthcare cost., Beyond impact of research collaborations that will drive future tests and revenue, we have made significant progress in a number of key other areas as we advance our goal of leveraging our market leading molecular oncology capabilities and our global footprint to become the premier partner for personalizing oncology diagnostics from bench to bed side., Earlier I referenced the strong market momentum we continue to see in our business as evidenced by our 206% year-over-year growth and an increase in our contracted revenue with bio pharma customers which is now increased to over 30 million. While Ed will discuss the financial details in greater detail later in this call let me provide you with some key highlights of the trends and results from the first quarter., Importantly our 2014 acquisitions and the synergies we are experiencing from these acquisitions continue to meaningfully contribute to our growth and market penetration. Our new locations in North Carolina and India are driving an increasing number of clinical trials who have been selected to power and provide testing services for, that number’s now well over 70 and we are increasing the number of cross-selling opportunities with some at our largest biopharma customers., In addition, with the additional locations and capabilities we are now running larger size clinical trials, some of which are now spanning multiple laboratory locations. We are very excited about the level of integration we have achieved in the past few quarters and expect this will provide unique value to our customers and to our shareholders. Our infrastructure coupled with the integrated products and portfolio we continue to develop and update and that our customers are rapidly adopting are providing us the backbone to be the leader on oncology diagnostic., Taking a closer look at some of the first quarter financial results, our first quarter year-over-year revenue increased 206% or $3 million to $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This is up sharply from $1.4 million for the three months ending March 31, 2014. Of significance our biopharma service business increased 578% or $2.8 million to $3.2 million in the first quarter of this year and that was up from $491,000 in the same period for 2013., We also improved our gross profit margin significantly year-over-year from 9.8% in 2014 to 28.1% for the first quarter of this year. The majority of this improvement came from improved use of our lab and our staff and better capacity utilization but also improvements to our workflow as we expand our biopharma business and focus our clinical business on more profitable ordering sites. We expect that we will continue to see ongoing gross margin improvements throughout the quarters., A financial metric that is particularly important to note is our overall operating loss which year-over-year changed only 5% while our revenues increased by over 200%. [indiscernible] at this metric because over 90% of our gross profit margin dropped to our operating income. We think this is an important metric and demonstrates both the potential leverage of the business and the rapid progress we have made with the acquired teams., While I am pleased with the momentum and significantly positive trends and results we are seeing in our business I would like to spend a little time discussing some of the key 2015 strategic initiatives and the progress that we are making in a number of important areas., First, with respect to our growing NGS portfolio we are continuing to build a dominant position in the area of hematological malignancies or blood bone cancers with offerings in CRL and myeloid cancer having launched and future launches in multiple myeloma and lymphoid cancer expected for later this year. We have also launched a major driver of growth for us in the India market, our focus Hotspot panel for solid tumors, which targets the five most common solid tumors., Our most recent launch Focus::Myeloid, helps clinicians and cancer centers improve the management and treatment of more than 275,000 patients in the U.S. that are currently living with myeloid malignancies. In addition, over a 100 clinical studies are been conducted by biotech and biopharma companies for compounds targeting myeloid cancers and many of these trials can potentially benefit from CGI’s Focus::Myeloid panel. Focus::Myeloid provides information to improve enrollment, stratification and treatment monitoring for these complex myeloid malignancies., As you know we are actively developing a pipeline of NGS panels targeting a variety of other cancers as well, including hematologic and solid tumors through our internal innovation efforts. In addition, CGI expects to launch NGS panels that are currently in development through Oncospire Genomics, our joint venture with Mayo Clinic. The first of which is multiple myeloma which will be coming out later this year., Our dominant position in hematologic cancer is contributing to our strong growth and contracted revenue expectations from the biopharma and biotech companies. This number increased to $30 million as of the end of the first quarter and in addition we also recently launched an NGS based panel targeting five most common solid tumors for the Indian and broader Asian markets. This NGS panel can be applied to over 370,000 patients in India alone and as a result of this launch we have seen significant uptick in the order volume, revenue and contract discussions with both clinical and research customers., Another key initiative for 2015 is increasing market penetration for our blockbuster genomic technology for HPV-related and surgical cancer testing, FHACT. Last month FHACT received conditional license from --licensure from the New York State Department of Health. We think this is an important milestone since it allows the company now to market the test to women's health centers, gynecologists and oncologists throughout the State of New York, which represents more than 7.6 million women. While cervical cancer screening protocols are relatively well established there remain significant unmet need to supplement current screening methods which are live [ph] and subject to cytological examination or just mapping the presence of the HPV virus., We think that with our test we can not only better detect HPV ovarian cancers earlier but also predict progression to advance disease. CGI's stock test which assesses genomic changes, common [indiscernible] cervical cancer identified women that are at high risk of the disease. In addition, we expect data later this year from a stack-related [ph] study that we just finalized with the National Cancer Institute in over 300 [ph] patients. We also expect a number of publications focused on FHACT and the launch of a multisite health economic study that will demonstrate the economic value and positive patient outcomes related to FHACT., In a critical area of billing and reimbursement, clinical reimbursement we continue to make steady progress. We recently signed an agreement with America's Choice provider network and an independent national network of healthcare providers, which allows us access to over 1,100 out of network payers and allows our diagnostic services to be available to more than 19 million domestic members. I'm very excited about the progress our team has delivered and continues to deliver and where our business is growing today. We believe it's heading -- we really believe it's heading in terms of not only its growth but its impact on patients and the ability to be a true partner for the broader oncology community., We have a broad portfolio of innovative industry leading products with a number of others on the way, a number of key strategic initiatives that will actually broaden our reach and accelerate our growth in both the clinical and biopharma community, I’ll touch on some of those later in the call. And we continue to demonstrate solid market penetration and market adoption, all of which has caused [ph] revenue expansion in our growth going forward., At this point, I'll hand over the call to our CFO, Ed Sitar for a review of our first quarter and our -- first quarter 2015 financial results Ed?, Thank you, Ed. We had a number of value enhancing accomplishments just in the first several months of this year and we expect this to continue driving value for us and our shareholders throughout the rest of 2015. We’ll walk through some of those before we turn to Q&A., First our focus on reimbursement; we’ve been actively working with payers and insurance companies in a very disciplined manner, since revamping our clinical revenue cycle team and we expect to make several updates on coverage and network decisions as the year progresses. Second, additional new developments and commercial partnerships; we’re working on number of commercial partnerships that will increase our proprietary programs, getting in to the marketplace, delivering our suite of services to a greater variety of customers and driving uptick in patient volume. Therefore we think these are very important channel and commercial partnerships that will drive continued growth of our business., Additional product launches is our third, beyond the product launches I touched on earlier we also expect the very first panel through our 50-50 joint venture with the Mayo Clinic, OncoSpire Genomics in multiple myeloma to launch second half of this year. We are on track to developing a very unique panel for the diagnosis and management of multiple myeloma patients. We’re also on track for an accelerated launch of our first targeted test for lung cancer which no other group currently has in the marketplace., We also expect further market penetration for FHACT. The recent conditional licensure from New York State Department of Health is a positive step toward accomplishing this objective. We’ve also retooled ourselves on our clinical sales team to really address this market that has over 2 million tests alone annually that can be improved for the outcome of women. As I said in our March call we’ll continue bringing those women health centers and laboratories into trails and migrating them to routine ordering sites as the year progresses., Fifth, further expanding upon our innovation we see a crucial element to accelerating on our growth. We’ve number of initiatives to make our company more relevant in emerging areas of oncology, namely in neuro-oncology bringing together schematic and germ-line testing for patients in clinical trials, providing testing for hereditary cancers and developing targeted knowledge base in a number of cancers where CGI has unique insight, unique access and knowledge about the disease., We think these four areas will continue to allow us to access a wider place in the market, drive further growth and make us a more valuable partner in delivering oncology diagnostics from bench to bed side. With that I would like to now open the line for questions.]","[Yes, Paul, first of all thank you, very good question. One of the unique features about our business is exactly is what's you're touching on. Many of the protocols and testing algorithms that we're using in these trails will make their way into the clinic. And when they do make their way into clinic CGI is uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice to provide that testing. I would say today, not all of those will be -- not all of those will develop into companion diagnostics or into testing algorithms., And some of them may result in additional studies with pharma customers. But today the way we look at those 70 we think well over half of those trials are unique. And about half of those trials, about one fourth overall, about 15 to 17, we think have a potential for become a companion testing or therapeutic monitoring type option., We continue to see strong momentum in Q2 as well. So it's -- I think Q1 was a good start but we continue to see the same blueprint. And in fact we're actually seeing even more traction with existing customers in Q2. We continue to see the momentum building actually in our biopharma business., Good morning Ben., Good question Ben, thank you. We -- some of our biggest work in Q1 was in next gen sequencing type. We have a number of trails that have begun adopting our CLL panel, and in fact also myeloid panel. So we don’t break out the NGS specifically as a percentage of revenue but it was a significant driver of growth for us in the quarter. And that's across multiple sites there. Yeah, there is the Hotspot panel that we launched in NDM contributed to it, RCLL [ph] panel that we launched contributed very heavily to it and other NGS study. So it's across all sites, NGS has been a strong driver for us., Yes, so I think we -- so you just asked two questions and I'll try to dice them apart, the first question is really about bringing the tumor Hotspot panel to the U.S. market. We think that's very muted in the U.S. and but there are other providers, not immunologists [ph] to offer something unique in the marketplace. So we think same variation with solid tumor Hotspot panel. In India the timing is very important, number one, to access the market there. The five tumors conditions are the vast majority and are we bringing the right portfolio for the right geography also. So I think we are focusing on Tumor Hotspot but in a way that we can make it unique and value additive to the community there., In terms of database and tracking we’ve started developing targeted databases. As you know the genomic conditions underlying each cancer are slightly different in how they can be interpreted even if it’s the same mutation or aberration can be different in different diseases. So we really are believers in disease specific cancer knowledge basis. So we are in the process of launching not only one for surgical but for CLL and B-cell cancers and also for the tumor Hotspot in India. So those are things that we’ll be providing more color on as the year progresses and we think that will be an important element of the value building for our company., That’s a great question thank you Sung Ji for that. The sales force expansion in biopharma business continues where I would say we are pleased with where it is but the opportunity for us there is very large and growing rapidly. There is a tremendous need for the type of services that we are providing and let me give you a case study that I think will highlight that but head on we are in the early part of our sales force expansion here. So we continue to look for sales people that are the right types of people to help us develop these markets and have the right kind of content and knowledge to carry our brand in to the marketplace., That said we are getting also a lot of synergy from the acquisition and a lot of opportunities from customers of CGI that want the expanded capabilities and customers of the acquisition that want the CGI capabilities. In fact that’s one of the biggest areas that we see today in our pipeline is exactly the synergies that we were hoping for. And so part of that has really, recall kind of almost not necessarily sales driven but really house or capability driven revenue growth which is fantastic, of course but we need to continue investing our sales force and that will drive even further market penetration for us., We also are in discussions with a number of partners and we think that’s very important to know. We are working actively with partners that we think can be massive multiplier effects for our sales force., Yes, I think that’s safe to say, reimbursement pressure was pretty much across the product lines. As you know more in certain areas like FISH and some of the genomic panels than in other areas. We did see slight increase in some of our IHC work that we are doing which is now digital but clearly we did see several points of pressure in the clinical side and we continue to see delays in paying NGS type panels there as well. So I think we’re in for several quarters, broadly not just here but broadly in the clinical community a concern about how a lot of these genomic panels get paid., The good news about our approach that we think is very different, is we really started very active dialog with payers about our targeted disease specific panels. We think this puts us in a driver seat to help them look at how reporting out and the delivery of targeted information that’s already validated for specific diseases helps them. So we think this is very unique position that we are in today versus a lot of our peers out there., The other reason that we think that it’s very important that we are in a better position to get reimbursement is many of the genomic panels are the assay type [ph] test that are offered by our peers. They don’t have the comprehensive lab capabilities, often times insurers and third party groups will not pay for what perceive to be as the high end of the test, especially if it’s not already in the guideline unless you already have done a test using traditional technology or methodologies that are widely accepted, regardless of how accurate or how specific they are., For example, often times in a blood-borne cancer people rely initially on a flow-based test and then reflex to a genomic panel or they rely on a FISH-based test that may or may not give accurate results and then go on to a more thorough comprehensive genomic panel. In both those cases we’re in a great position because we can reflux right now in our lab and we can demonstrate through the clinical history of that test, that the test A was a clear suggestion to then do Test B. That really helps us significantly and what we’re finding from feedback from payers that our new Head of Vendors [ph] that Dr. Randy Goodman [ph] has been leading is that comprehensive capability of having the entire disease focused library at one site is a massive win for us., And we have number of case studies now that we’ve developed not only for our sales force but for the insurers to show them for example in CLL or myeloid cancer or in cervical cancer how having the complete capabilities and then being able to put our cash into the whole stream, helps to make a decision, drives cost down and gets people to treatment faster and without having to resample the patient. So we think that industry is maturing in terms of its approach to listening about these issues. But we’re still think it’s going to be a quarter or two before, they say okay we will routinely pay for all the stuff, day in and day out., And as you know these days it’s a very, very fractured industry out there in terms of how the insurance groups pay for it, but I think we’re in a great position and we got great data and of course our business model where we can do all the testing helps us., Good yourself?, Sure. I think as I can elaborate our focus is ready go on more of a profitable customer segments and customers who are going to be able to bring entire portfolio capabilities too. So I think just a quality of revenue, quality of process as you’re seeing we’ve have massive growth and we continue to in our Biopharma business, and as we continue to grow the Biopharma business we have got to put the resources at the right places and look at profitability, for cash profitability per count, potential profitability on the same measures., So we’ve really decided to focus slightly more in Biopharma in terms of better sales model and then focusing on the clinical sites that we think are going to big long-term profit drivers for us and our shareholders., So market opportunity if I can assume there we’re mostly focusing Pharmacogenomics for oncology and that we do think that can be spilled over into other disease stage as well. Many of the new targeted drugs and many of the new combination regimens do require some Pharmacogenomic profiling or Pharmacogenomic monitoring and so we think we are very uniquely positioned to deliver that information because we’re already delivering information on the schematic genome., Again that was one of the driver kind of our desire to do the acquisition of Gentris last year. In terms of market size and market opportunity we haven’t specifically tied PGX in oncology, that PGX itself in the U.S. is close to a $1 billion opportunity but PGX also is being done [ph] not only in patients but also for clinical trials, naturally the majority of our work is being done today. A lot of that will now go into the clinical settings as well as we get unique data and unique insight., And we think this for us add potentially tens of thousands of new tests for us every quarter that we can have access too. And then more importantly we think more value towards clinical sites because we’ll have the data not only of the disease and cancer and also have the data on the pharmacogenomic profile of that patient, and marrying those together we think is a big motive differentiation., I think it is a great question. In terms of translation of that opportunity, of that issue into [indiscernible] I think it is early but it’s beginning. I think almost every conversation that I have with academic research groups about lack of adequate -- line information and the profile of patients we have had. I was at Mayo last week, to discuss that in length, we discussed in terms of how it will impact, how we do variant cause and how we potentially can gather germ line [ph] to our observed germ line materials at the same time, it’s impacting the entire industry. I think we can definitely not stick our head in the sand say we are going to come with the bio-informatic driven solution. And we have to aware that germ line and schematics, remove the tumor from the DNA -- remove the DNA from the tumor itself is very important and it is something that our team has brought up several years back and that had let us to have vision of bringing the two pieces together., So I don’t think it’s -- I think there is a lot of thought and lot of discussion, I think mostly those pharma partners that we have talked to, say the same thing and they do recognize that as an issue and as a way that can potentially change their impact. Now for us it’s not only having the capabilities of doing both and having data based capabilities but also for us because we have targeted panels for disease specific we actually tune these panels to be more focused on that disease category so changes for us reporting out germ line variance is minimized. And that’s also an important -- what I think about it is truly a knowledge base driven approach., That said the insurance companies pay for that. They understand it, patients and clinicians who can understand know it takes some time till it makes it’s way well into wider marketplace but it is definitely a topic that is relevant today and probably drives significant more opportunity for us and biopharma earlier and then into the clinical setting after it., Thank you, Ben., Yes, absolutely so we expect to a launch a lymphoid cancer panel and it is very unique and we also expect to launch a multiple myeloma panel, that would be through a joint venture with Mayo Clinic and we also expect to -- the first version of the lung cancer test in Mayo Clinic into market as well. We also expect to then have our PGX or pharmacogenomics comprehensive profiler into the market later this year and those are the four that we think will be come on track for the second-half of this year., Thank you very much.]",2190,2258,4448
1,10.html,"(Q1, 2015)","Cancer Genetics, Inc.",CFO and Treasurer,True,CGIX,Edward Sitar,"[Thank you Panna and good morning everybody. We had a very strong first quarter. Revenues were $4.4 million, a 206% increase over the first quarter of 2014 and 8% higher sequentially than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our revenue is broken down in to three categories; biopharma services or services and test performed as part of clinical trials. Biopharma services revenue grew 578% over the first quarter of 2014. This was driven by organic growth in our Select One business and the synergies from our acquisitions., Clinical services or tests performed for prescribing clinicians. Clinical services revenue decreased by 7% or $66,000 when compared to Q1, 2014. Test mix between Medicare and private insurance companies and the related pricing pressure is responsible for this reduction. To address this challenge the company has adjusted clinical sales efforts to focus on customers that are more profitable and have clear needs for CGI's proprietary portfolio., Discovery services are services provided in the development of new testing [indiscernible] methods for research organizations. Discovery services generated a $166,000 of revenue, up 54% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2014. Cost of revenues increased to 143% or $1.9 million, cost of revenues from the acquired businesses was $1.2 million. Lab supplies increased by $280,000 and shipping and compensation costs increased by $234,000., Gross margins were 28.1% or $1.2 million, which compares to 9.8% or $140,000 in the first quarter of 2014. The improvement in gross margin percentage is attributable to better utilization of cost along with the margin from our acquired businesses. Total operating expenses were $5.4 million in the quarter compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year. Included in the operating expenses are stock based compensation expenses of $696,000 in Q1, 2015 versus $530,000 in Q1 2014., Research and development expenses in the first quarter increased by 114% or $681,000 to $1.3 million. The increase includes a full quarter of activity from OncoSpire, our joint venture with the Mayo Clinic. In Q1 2015 our share of the loss was $207,000 compared to $12,000 last year. Compensation cost increased by $164,000 and supplies cost increased by $152,000. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter increased 9% or $255,000 to $3 million. Our acquired operations contributed $544,000 to the expense and this was offset by reductions in compensation cost of $327,000., Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2015 increased 49% or $367,000 to $1.1 million, primarily due to the sales efforts of our acquired operations. Our shares outstanding at March 31, 2015 were 9,831,169. Our diluted shares for the quarter were 9,703,576. Our net loss in the first quarter was $4.3 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.27 per diluted share in the corresponding period in 2014., We had total cash at March 31, 2015 of $28.6 million, which includes the $6 million restricted to the company’s loan facility with Wells Fargo. As we discussed in this morning’s release we have successfully refinanced that facility and removed the restriction on that cash. In addition we have secured $4 million of additional borrowing capacity., I will now turn the call back to Panna.]",[Good morning Ben. How are you?],469,6,475
2,100.html,"(Q1, 2015)",Startek Inc.,President and CEO,True,SRT,Chad Carlson,"[Thank you, Joyce. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining, an exciting day at StarTek for sure. We’ll discuss today’s acquisition announcement in a few minutes, but first I’ll discuss the first quarter results., StarTek’s first quarter revenue was flat versus the same quarter last year, due primarily to lower AT&T volume, which I’ll further discuss later and the closure of Costa Rica. In the face of these reductions, our intense focus on the execution of our strategy to create healthier revenue diversification was elevated. Revenue outside of telecommunications and cable including STARTEK Health grew 197% versus the same quarter of last year to over $16 million., During the quarter we won $10.5 annual contract value of new business, including five new clients, consisting of healthcare,financial services and consumer products to name a few. With regard to our AT&T relationship, I’ve some good news and bad news. We have been navigating many changes. If you recall, during the late Q2 of last year, we transitioned one of our large sites from mobility care to consumer mobility credit and collections. We’re now considered by AT&T to be a strategic partner for the credit and collections group, due to strong performance and a good relationship., Over the past five years, the mobility care group has been executing on a vendor consolidation strategy and this was one of the largest blocks of business StarTek had with AT&T. As AT&T moved on that strategy, StarTek experienced some lost revenue. The best defense was to keep execution strong and fight doing other business. This prevented us from taking larger losses. During the transition last year, aside from a new agreement for lower pricing, we expected volumes will come back in line. That query has not occurred., Volumes with this group has been much lower than the client expected, at the same time AT&T has been bringing some work back to the US and as the quarter closed, we were informed the last remaining mobility care work we had in the Philippines will also be going away. These impacts will play out through this year, affecting approximately 5% of our revenue. Performance over the past couple of years has helped to rebuild our brand with AT&T and we’ve recently launched some key projects and are in discussions on other opportunities., Gross margin was 9.6%, a decrease from Q1 of last year. This was negatively impacted by the revenue dynamics I just outlined, as well as bringing on four new sites. Three of the four new sites were at or near our margin targets as we excited first quarter. During the subsequent quarter end, we reduced total Manila seats by 250, with a move to a very nice facility in Frontera Verde, not too far from the old site in Ortigas, which will be a great environment for our brand warriors. We’ve also discontinued operations in our Oklahoma facility and do not plan to keep that site., Due to the revenue dynamics mentioned, our capacity utilization is lower and consequently we’ll be doing CapEx plans for added capacity as we work our existing capacity in line with our pipeline opportunities. This is always an interesting balance to manage. I’m very happy to announce that we’ve now completed the data center moves related to the IT platform initiative. While this was a difficult transition for the team, StarTek now sits on a reliable, scalable and very robust IT platform, which will enable our future and require a little capital to scale and update., Today, StarTek announced the acquisition of Accent Marketing Services. Accent is a business process outsourcing company, providing contact center services and Customer Engagement Agency solutions with six locations in US and Jamaica. Accent’s data driven approach helps brands maximize their engagement with consumers and enables brands to influence behavior, all while generating a better return on investment across all customer touch points, including phone, online and social media channels. Accent has 18 clients across several industries, including telecom, technology, retail, financial services and consumer products., I’m excited at the opportunity to combine Accent with ideal dialogue to form a very capable customer engagement agency to help our clients develop a customer strategy through the use of data and analytics to improve the customer experience. We’re then able to support clients to execute that strategy through our omni-channel contacts and they’re staffed with over 14,000 brand warriors. The purchase price for this transaction is $16 million and we’re financing this through our new credit facility with BMO Harris Bank. We expect to close to no later than May 31. Accent’s current annual revenue run rate is approximately $67 million and based on the synergies we can achieve through integrating the StarTek advantage system, which now includes a new IT platform, the purchase price is approximately 3.5 times EBITDA on a standalone basis., We expect to achieve most of these synergies by the end of this year making a transaction accretive to our shareholders in 2016. Taking on debt is not a decision we made lively and we we’re determined to increase our margins and generate the free cash flow necessary to pay this debt down quickly. The board now are very deliberate in this position and the team has completed expensive diligence and now we must execute. We have a very strong pipeline and the differentiation of our client engagement and the value of the StarTek advantage system is evident with 15 new clients, one last year and five more in the first quarter of this year. We’ll continue to work hard on executing for existing clients and convert pipeline opportunities into new clients and continued revenue diversification., The goal to deliver sustainable, predictable, profitable growth has always required improved revenue diversification. The strategic plan to grow our client base, expand verticals and add higher valued services, has been underway now for almost four years with a lot success to show. With continued strong performance for our clients and converting a very strong pipeline into wins, we’ll work hard to keep revenue growth back on track by the end of this year and begin to generate cash from our existing and new capacity. Now, with Accent, we’ll have a more robust costumer engagement agency offering in over 50 client’s brands being protected and promoted by StarTek brand warriors., Joyce, Lisa and I will now take questions.]","[Probably a little less than that, Adam., We’ll try to balance that with our pipeline., Yeah, we cannot provide guidance as a matter of policy, but the bulk of our synergy is probably won’t be achieved until towards the end of Q4., Hey, Omar. Omar, Yes., That’s why I tried to really focus on the fact that we’ve been declared a strategic partner for that group and working some opportunities there., I was thinking of 2015 total revenue., Well, I think we’ve addressed that with the first quarter read out where the bulk of the softness is coming from and certainly from an year-over-year basis, Costa Rica is a part of that as well., I think if you review my comments you’ll be able to get to that, Omar, post synergies., We have stated that this - this is an investment here for us and while we’ll try to stage our current capacity expansion plans as close to our pipeline as possible and demand, we were planning this year as an investment year, setting ourselves up for 2016 to really much less in our capital expenditures in expansion and focus on optimizing our profitability really beginning to guide free cash flow. And that’s the focus we’ll have certainly into next year, so that we can generate free cash flow required to deliver the company., We’ll see., Thank you, Omar., Hey, Alex., And that’s more material too., Yes., Yes., We’d like to not get into too much of that right now, until we get best horizon, Alex., Which should less stress the strength of our pipeline and that balance. So it’s interesting to balance capacity, try to bring that in line with the capacity requirements as tight as possible., Well, it’s [indiscernible] where Lisa mentioned, Iloilo, she mentioned on APAC is there. So it will be not much past that., Yes., Thank you., Yeah, I think the double digit obviously is put under lot of pressure now with this development, but by the end of the year with the pipeline, hope to get that back on track., Thank you.]",1054,346,1400
2,100.html,"(Q1, 2015)",Startek Inc.,CFO,True,SRT,Lisa Weaver,[],"[More for 2016, Adam., It’ll be minimal CapEx and it would just be some typical integration OpEx, but it’s not anything that got significant from our perspective., Yes, approximately 2,000, Yeah, between the acquisition and some of the volume softness that Chad referenced in his comments will be slowing that down., Yeah and the incremental capacity we’ve picking up with Accent., Correct., It came from both the domestic segment and Asia Pacific segment. Asia Pacific is still diluted if you will, for the cost of the new capacity we brought on last year in [indiscernible]. And then also the transition from the Ortigas facility to the Frontera Verde facility during the quarter had some redundant cost or duplicate read for a period of time while we were bringing the new set up. The Asia Pacific wise in fact impacted by more volume softness with AT&T that share diluted to the results of some of the new site movement at play there as well., Yeah, it was less than a 100 basis points overall for the quarter because as Chad mentioned, three of the four new sites we brought on last year either at or near our margin targets. The segment that was impacted the most from bringing new capacity online was Asia Pacific, as I mentioned in the previous question, but then obviously the segment that benefited the most from closure was Latin America, with the exit of Costa Rica during the year, last year., But clarify that, are you asking it sequentially as it all came out or just it all. We started to see some of that in fourth quarter I would say, but just was either impact - quite the impact that we saw in first quarter., Yeah, the primary - but the primary impact was AT&T. I mean you know this business Omar, it adds and flows and can be lumpy. So we certainly saw [indiscernible] with our other clients, but yeah, there’s significant impact we need to address with AT&T., Correct., We’ll have some this quarter, 200 might be a little high., Yes., Yes., It will be released with the second quarter queue., Yeah, I think it will be spread over the balance of the year. Again we’re going to really balance bringing capacity online as the pipeline and client needs suggest, so I think it’s reasonable to assume that be Q2 and Q3, Omar., Well, we do have the commitments for Tegucigalpa, you recall last year we opened it, facilities for that capacity will come online later this year as well. And then we’ll get through the Accent integration and assess what our needs are by market at that point., We do have leases signed for both Wichita and Hamilton; Hamilton, Ohio and Wichita, Kansas, but the CapEx really is the build out and somewhat IT equipments that we would invest in the site to bring it online and that when we talk about timing and pushing it out, that’s what we’re talking about., Yeah and Alex, if I could just clarify, we haven’t back bannered Hamilton and Wichita. We will continue to assess that based on our pipeline and determine what the appropriate timing is for both of those facilities, as it relates to our current footprint and the Accent footprint., Yeah, the majority of that will be in the domestic segments, but there is a portion that will be categorized as near shore.]",0,568,568

Thank you all for joining. Before we get to the results for the quarter, you will have seen that we reported some important news. Today, we have announced that Daniel Zhang will become CEO of Alibaba Group effective May 10. Our current CEO, Jonathan Lu, will work with Daniel to ensure a successful transition in the coming months. Jonathan will remain on the Board of Directors of Alibaba Group as Vice Chairman. In this capacity, Jonathan will play an important role in developing the future leaders of Alibaba Group., We have a strong and deep bench of talented executives who will help lead the company for years to come, and today's announcement reflects our commitment to continuing to develop strong leadership from within. On behalf of Jack Ma and the entire Alibaba family, I want to express our personal gratitude to Jonathan Lu for his strong leadership and management over the past several years, and we all look forward to his continued contribution as a key leader., Most of you have met and know well our new CEO, Daniel Zhang. Daniel has been with the company for 8 years. He has successfully managed important businesses across our organization, and he is one of the founding members of the Alibaba Partnership. Daniel is a proven business leader and innovator, with a strong track record of delivering results. He has the confidence of our entire management team, and there is no better person to lead Alibaba Group as we embark on the next stage of our growth., This management transition is part of our progress to build the commerce infrastructure of the future. In addition to investing in cloud computing, logistics, Big Data technology, cross-border trade capability and our ecosystem partners, we believe it is important to invest in and strengthen our talent. This is needed in order to embrace the challenges of high growth, scale and complexity in executing against our vision for consumers and businesses around the world to meet, work and live at Alibaba., I also want to note that, today, we are pleased to announce the appointment of Börje Ekholm to the Alibaba Group Board of Directors. Mr. Ekholm will serve as an independent director of our board, and he will also serve as a member of the Audit Committee. Mr. Ekholm brings extensive experience in the areas of business, finance, capital markets, corporate governance and technology. We are thrilled to have a director of Mr. Ekholm's caliber, and we look forward to working with him., Now turning to the quarter. I will begin with a few brief comments, and then Daniel will provide a business review of the past fiscal year, then Maggie will present the financials. Daniel will then discuss our strategic priorities going forward., In the quarter that ended March 31, which is our fiscal fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that we saw continued strong growth across our core operating metrics. We grew gross merchandise volume across our China retail marketplaces by 40% year-on-year. In just the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, we achieved USD 97 billion in China retail GMV., A key reason for this strong GMV growth is the continued growth in active buyers across our platforms, driven by the increased reach of our mobile commerce apps to users across China and our successful execution in converting users to buyers. An active buyer is someone who came to our retail marketplaces to make at least one purchase during the period of measurement. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, our annual active buyers increased to 350 million, compared to 255 million in the 12 months ended March 31, 2014. This growth represents an increase of 37% year-on-year., We continue to expand our strong position and competitive advantage as the unrivaled leader in mobile commerce across China. In March this year, we achieved 289 million monthly active users on our mobile commerce apps, which is a net increase of 24 million monthly active users from December and a 77% year-on-year increase from the 163 million reported in March last year. The strength in mobile commerce demonstrates our ability to attract mobile users with strong commercial intent on a scale that we believe is unrivaled by any of our peers in China or globally., Turning to mobile GMV. For the quarter, we saw USD 49 billion in mobile GMV, an increase of 157% compared to the same quarter a year ago. It is very important to note that mobile GMV now accounts for 51% of total GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces in this quarter, compared to 42% in the prior quarter and 27% for the quarter ended March last year. Maggie will address the financials in more detail in her comments, but our overall revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, increased by 45% year-on-year., We are also reporting today that mobile revenue from the China commerce retail business increased by 352% to USD 846 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Mobile revenues in the current quarter now make up 40% of our China commerce retail revenue, compared to 12% in the same quarter last year. With increasing mobile GMV and mobile revenue, we're executing well against our strategy of aggressively transitioning existing users and acquiring new users to our mobile platform as well as increasing monetization of the mobile interface at a steady pace., Looking ahead, we believe that the continued trend towards mobile provides us with a unique advantage to deliver a better consumer experience as well as more value to merchants. Therefore we believe the increasing use of our mobile e-commerce apps will continue to fuel significant future growth. Taken together, the results we are reporting today show our strong foundation for future sustained growth., I would now like to turn the call over to Daniel.]","[Yes, Chun Ming, this is Joe Tsai. I'll talk about the management change question. This is really -- I mean, Alibaba is always very good at continuously developing and improving the management of our company. And I think with the CEO transition of Daniel, we have also brought in some younger folks to run some of the core businesses like Tmall. As you know, Jeff Zhang who was running Taobao Marketplace is now running both Tmall, Taobao Marketplace and also Juhuasuan, so he has all the e-commerce marketplaces underneath him. We also have some other terrific executives in other leadership positions, in B2B, in cloud computing. In the case of the Alimama marketing platform, we, through the acquisition of UCWeb, we were able to brought on board a very strong executive in Yu Yongfu, and he has proven over the months of integration, to bring a lot of value to and insight to our business. And so we decided that it was appropriate and the right time for him to take over the Alimama business. But this is a process that we are continuously undergoing. We always are looking for talented, young executives to take on more responsibility. And we're extremely thrilled to have Daniel taking over the leadership of this group with the wholehearted support from management., Carlos, on your second question. When a user has a mobile device, the user tends to use it more frequently. So number one, the frequency of purchases go up because mobile is just so convenient. And anytime, anywhere you are, when you think about buying something, especially in sort of impulse items, it's just very easy to get on the mobile and buy something. The second thing on user experience is that because of mobile, the collection of data can be more customized, for example, location-based data. That could help us target the users better. And on the seller end, we have recently launched a tool integrated into our mobile Taobao app that enables the sellers to manage the entire storefront through mobile. So they don't even need to own a PC or a notebook computer to manage their storefront. So we would -- we made it very, very easy for them to manage their storefront. So we're doing all these things to make it easy for both buyers and sellers to transact on the mobile platform., Yes, I just want to comment on the -- there's a question on the M&A strategy in -- especially overseas, I just wanted to comment on that. We have -- we're looking at M&A sort of outside of China in 2 types of situations. The first one is we're always looking to invest in minority stakes in companies that we see as having disruptive technology or business ideas. And there, the main purpose is to back entrepreneurs and establish the relationship and learn from these entrepreneurs. So that is one type of category. The other, when we venture out to -- out of China to do something, it is usually with a view toward improving the customer experience that tie back to our core business. So for example, we made an investment in Singapore Post because we are looking at cross-border logistics, making sure that sellers that selling from China to all over the world, especially to Southeast Asia consumers, can have a better experience when it comes to logistics, okay.]",951,569,1520

I'd like to start by reviewing some highlights of our fiscal 2015 operational and financial results. USD 394 billion of GMV was generated on our marketplaces in fiscal 2015. Active buyers in the last 12 months grew to 350 million. Mobile MAUs grew to 289 million. We earned USD 12.3 billion in revenue, representing a 45% increase from the revenue generated in fiscal 2014.

Number one was the significant expansion of our ecosystem. We grew our active buyers, especially in rural areas, and improved services and tools for our important -- for our sellers. We also expanded key categories and upgraded our logistic infrastructures., Number two was our unrivaled mobile leadership. We made a big push for the Mobile Taobao App this year, and it was very successful. Our mobile GMV grew 212% in fiscal 2015, driven by incredible net adds of 126 million mobile users. Over 50% GMV came from mobile devices during the final quarter of 2015, and we ended the year with 289 million mobile MAUs., Number three [ph] was our investment in data and cloud computing platform. We remain the #1 cloud service provider in China. In fiscal 2015, we made technology improvements and with -- that significantly increased our power efficiency, and we expanded and diversified our customer base., Number four was our pioneer cross-border commerce. Tmall Global captured consumer mind share as a source of high-quality products, and we attracted major global brands and retailers to our platform. We also established a strong cross-border logistics infrastructure., Number five was strategic M&A investments and alliances. We invested or partnered with the 5 different areas in 2015: mobile, entertainment, e-commerce and logistics, O2O/travel and healthcare., That's the end of business review. I'd like to turn back to Maggie for financial review., Thank you, Maggie. Finally, I would like to add a few words about our priorities in the coming year. Our 2016 priorities fall into 3 main categories: expanding and upgrading our existing platform services, developing new businesses and people development., In the first category, expanding and upgrading our existing services, we will focus on quality GMV growth; costumer acquisition, with particularly emphasis on mobile and rural users; empowering sellers to better serve customers, especially on mobile; local services., In the second category, developing new businesses, our focus will be primarily on cloud computing, specifically extending services for a broader base of third-party customers; cross-border, especially the import business; building up our affiliate marketing network; developing mobile Internet services; and investing in entertainment., Finally, underlying all these priorities is the ongoing necessity of developing talent and building up our organization and culture. The size and scope of our ecosystem requires us to hire, retain and cultivate employees who can adapt to a dynamic, competitive and challenging business environment., Our success in doing this is the foundation of the future growth and the sustainability of our business, and it will be one of our biggest priorities in 2016 and beyond., That is the end of our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the phone lines for Q&A.]","[First of all, I would like to say that we don't manage our business by mobile and non-mobile, and we view this as an integrated platform and our consumers do online shopping across platforms. So it's a unified platform. In terms of take rate, I would say, today, more and more stuff and more and more sellers, they get used to do business on mobile because they observe that consumers shift from PC to mobile. So they are doing business on mobile and they start spending money on mobile to promote their storefront and items. And if you look at our take rate on the PC side, I will say, actually, the marketing revenue on the PC side in terms of the CPC and the click-through rate, and the spending actually still increased this quarter, offset by the increase in the commission revenue in this quarter. Because actually, in this quarter, we promote -- we had a quite good promotion in Tmall in the Chinese New Year and in March. So this is a upside. Then on the mobile side, actually, with development of the marketing tools and people will spend more money on mobile to promote their storefront., Okay. For the first question, actually, we are -- we have very smooth conversation with the government. And for the Ministry of Commerce, I think they are talking about the new regulation. And so far, we don't think this will impact our merchants. And because, today, the government is -- actually they encourage the SMEs and the entrepreneurs to start new business and create jobs. So we believe that in our Taobao Marketplace, we really give people the chance to start a new business. So we think that this, ultimately, is helpful for the people, for the business development and for the new entrepreneur., Okay, this is Daniel. I will answer the first question. When we look at the restructuring of the team and business, first thing we will think, how to -- in what kind of organization structure is a benefit for the customers. So for example, today, and a lot of Tmall merchants, they are the power seller and they're doing the day-to-day operation on Tmall platform, but they need a space to promote or to have a big event for them. So that's what exactly the Juhuasuan can provide. So to put all these Tmall business and Juhuasuan into one head, Jeff Zhang, I think is benefit for the customer and can give customers a one-stop solution in terms of the daily operation and promoting events. And second factor when we consider in the restructuring is that how to leverage our internal resources and improve the operating efficiency. So put all the Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan under one head, actually we can have each of these 3 platforms have a very strong unique position. The head, the BU head, they can -- he can oversee the entire business and to promote SMEs in Taobao and to serve the brand companies, the retailers in Tmall and give the promotion platform in Juhuasuan. So we believe this can help us to improve and grow our efficiency and reduce our internal conflicts., Yes, for the second question, Taobao GMV experienced a slowdown in the first quarter. The main reason is quite simple, it's the late Chinese New Year. We saw a rebound in March in Taobao GMV, and we will continue to promote the SMEs in Taobao Marketplaces. And we think that we can -- Taobao can show people a very unique experience, to give people a very unique experience in that, in selections., Well, it's a good question. Actually, this is really impact less on Tmall. The reason is that, in Taobao, most of the sellers are small sellers. So when they are coming to a holiday, they will -- because they are, their cash flow is quite tight. A small business always have a relatively tight cash flow, so they will pull back the inventory purchase and the stock to reduce stock to a lower level. But for large sellers in Tmall and they have quite flexible cash management. So that's why in Taobao, a lot of individuals, they will planning [ph] their stock during the Chinese New Year, and actually before Chinese New Year, until 2 weeks after Chinese New Year. And this year, because of a late Chinese New Year and we also had some impact in early March, so the business rebounded in the second half of the March, so that's why we experienced a slowdown in the first quarter in Taobao., Okay, for the first question, actually we -- last year, we view the Taobao mobile app as a top priority, so input a lot of resources in the company to -- in the development of our Taobao mobile app and promote our -- in the promotion of our Taobao mobile app. And this also gives us very good results. And today, people can go into Taobao mobile app to search and to navigate and find whatever they want from Taobao and Tmall. But also, people can go into Taobao mobile app first, then click the button of Tmall, then go to the page -- webpage of Tmall and start their journey in Tmall. But as you said, actually, we do understand that for Tmall, actually they need a separate app. But we have to make sure that this separate app should give people a different shopping experience and shopping journey. So that's why we are working very actively on the development of our new Tmall app, and we will promote this app when it is ready., Okay, for the first question, let me explain again, actually on PC, because more and more merchants they observe that traffic are shifting to mobile, so they start to spend money on mobile and better keywords. So that's why the CPC, cost-per-click, reduced on PC side because of lack of competition. And I tried to correct that. Actually on the PC side, it's not a CTR reduction. It's about because of the traffic shifting, part of the traffic shifting to the mobile side. So actually, the search traffic actually is going flat. So that, we believe, is the reason why we saw a decrease in the marketing revenue on the PC side. And for the second question about the growth of GMV in Tmall versus Taobao. And actually, we don't try to prioritize Tmall or prioritize Taobao. They are equally important to us. For this quarter, actually, why we have 2 promotions for Tmall, one is in Chinese New Year. Because in Tmall, we have partnered with a logistics company, which can help us to deliver the large appliances all across China, even in Chinese New Year. So we encouraged our seller on our platform who sells -- who are selling large appliances and they do the promotion during Chinese New Year. And the second one is the promoting in March. Actually, in March 8, we launched a promotion and which is encouraged consumers to scan the barcode and purchase. The vast majority of the items selected in this promotion is groceries from Tmall, so that's why Tmall enjoyed the benefit in this quarter from the promotion., Okay. Thank you, Dick. For the first question and -- we adopt, we adjust our recruitment policy in Tmall in early March, and we hired an entry -- we upgraded our entry standards. So the purpose of this is to increase the quality of the merchants. So for when we look at the Tmall operating methodology, we don't try to grow our business by number of merchants. Instead, we try to help our merchants to grow their business to help them to increase their sales -- to enjoy high sales store growth, same-store growth. So we believe that by adopting this new policy and the people will enjoy a better experience because we give them more confidence in the high-quality products. And all the merchants here are high quality, so we believe, ultimately, this should be a benefit for all the merchants here and also benefit for the long-term growth of Tmall. And for the second question, O2O. I would like to say that O2O to me is actually isn't a -- O2O cannot be a unified platform. It's very difficult to be a unified O2O platform because in each business, there is a O2O opportunity. And the online-to-offline business in certain business should be fully integrated. So our strategy is to identify and focus on some of the key areas, key industries and to restructure the business using the Internet -- use the Internet technology and thinking. For example, in the food and catering, in the car booking, and we participate in the travel sector. We, either we do this business by ourselves or we enter this sector by investment., For the cross-border business, and this is one of our priorities in the next year. And we have huge demand from Chinese consumer for high-quality foreign products. So this is also, we believe, the starting point of our globalization. So we will start with the import business and to bring more and more high-quality foreign brands, retailers and their products to China market. And today, we are in early stage, and we believe that we will have a -- the consumer will -- actually they welcome this high-quality product and we will enjoy a rapid growth in this sector.]",522,1575,2097
3,1000.html,"(Q4, 2015)",Alibaba Group Holding Limited,Chief Financial Officer,True,BABA,Wei Wu,"[Okay. Thank you, Daniel. Hello, everyone. Here are some highlights for the financial results. GMV grew 40% year-over-year to RMB 600 billion. Revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB 17.4 billion. Non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 49%, down from 57% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income grew 16% year-over-year to RMB 7.7 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS, excluding SBC and amortization of intangible assets and certain other items, was RMB 3, an increase of 7% compared to RMB 2.8 in the same quarter of 2014., In the March quarter, our blended monetization rate was 2.17% versus 2.18% in the year-ago period. The PC monetization rate was 2.63% versus 2.63% in March quarter 2014. Our mobile monetization rate has continued to improve, from 0.98% in March quarter last year to 1.73% this quarter. However, please note that we implemented certain measures in the year-ago quarter that artificially constrained mobile monetization rate in order to ensure user experience, so this quarter's mobile monetization rate has a relatively easy comparison to our March quarter 2014. Starting mid-June quarter 2014, we began to phase out these measures., Going forward, we expect improvement in mobile monetization to be driven by our ability to deliver more value to customers. Remember, improvement in mobile monetization may not always be linear, given seasonality and other factors that change each quarter. But we continue to strongly believe that the long-term trend in mobile monetization is positive., Year-on-year, our revenue grew 45% to RMB 17 billion, primarily driven by an increase in new active buyers. Both Taobao and Tmall GMV grew very well this quarter. However, Taobao GMV year-on-year growth was disproportionately impacted by the late timing of Chinese New Year holiday, while Tmall was not impacted as much due to special holiday promotions., Other revenue grew 169% on year-on-year basis in this quarter, driven by the consolidation of UCWeb and AutoNavi. The restructuring of our relationship with Ant Financial was completed in early February 2015. This had 2 impacts on the other revenue, a loss of interest income generated from the SME loan business and the addition of new income from Ant Financial equal to 2.5% of the average daily balance of SME loans pursuant to our agreement with Ant Financial. As I noted last quarter, this restructuring has a net income neutral impact on our financials. The decrease in revenue related to the SME loan business was offset by a decrease in expense related to the -- managing the loan portfolio., In the March quarter, our non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 49%, lower than 57% in the year-ago quarter. Our full fiscal year 2015 non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 53.5%, versus 58.5% in full fiscal year 2014. The decrease in non-GAAP EBITDA margin was due primarily to the consolidation of acquired business, mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi, and also to investments in new business initiatives, such as cloud computing, digital entertainment, mobile operating system and local services., Without the impact of the above factors, which totaled more than USD 1 billion, the non-GAAP EBITDA margin in fiscal year 2015 would be comparable to that in fiscal year 2014. This amount was less than 20% of our free cash flow in fiscal year 2015. We believe that our non-GAAP EBITDA margin in the high-50s in our core commerce business will remain stable going forward., In fiscal year 2016, we will continue to invest a portion of our free cash flow in new businesses, and we expect the growth of our new investment spending to be higher than our overall revenue growth., Now let's talk about our operating expenses. Non-GAAP cost of revenue was RMB 5.1 billion. Non-GAAP operating expense was RMB 4.4 billion. Non-GAAP product development expense was RMB 1.4 billion. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were RMB 1.9 billion. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense was RMB 1.1 billion., Non-GAAP cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our new business initiatives as well as an increase in the traffic acquisition costs as we expand our third-party affiliate marketing ecosystem., As noted last quarter, our fixed costs have increased in the year -- during the year, so which gives us operating leverage in a seasonally strong quarter, such as December quarter, but put downward pressure on our margins in seasonally weaker quarters, such as March quarter. Non-GAAP product development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased year-over-year, as we stopped paying royalty fees to Yahoo! after our IPO in mid-September. Excluding that factor, non-GAAP product development expense, non-GAAP sales marketing and non-GAAP G&A all increased due to the investments mentioned above., We generated RMB 5.7 billion free cash flow in March quarter, an increase from RMB 2.3 billion in the same quarter of the prior year. Our significant earnings and capital-efficient business model enable us to generate strong free cash flow. This provides us with the flexibility and the confidence to invest in new initiatives to add new users, improve engagement and customer experience and expand our ecosystem., Capital expenditures in March quarter were RMB 1.5 billion, an increase from RMB 0.4 billion in the year-ago period and a decrease from RMB 1.5 billion in December quarter. Our cash and cash equivalent position as of March 31, 2015, is very strong at RMB 108 billion. In addition, we have RMB 14 billion in short-term investments., Before I turn it to Daniel to discuss about 2016 strategy, I would like to address the issue of our headcount that received some media attention last week. I think Jack's comments was taken out of context. Our policy this year is to have no new net adds in headcount other than incoming employees to whom we have already made offers through campus recruiting., Just to put this in context. In year 2012, we enacted the same policy. We had almost no new net adds in headcount, and the GMV growth that year was 62%, which helped us reach our GMV milestone of RMB 1 trillion in fiscal 2013. At that time, we enacted a policy to encourage innovation and efficiency, and our reasons this year are exactly the same., Now I would like to turn it to Daniel.]","[So in terms of the area we're going to keep investing, so as we mentioned, the areas we invest in, in the past year, including these cloud computing, digital entertainment, local service and our mobile Internet services, we will continue making investment in these areas, keep expanding these new business., Chun Ming, this is Maggie. Regarding your second question on the lottery business. The lottery business grew really fast. It got -- it's suspended according to the new rules policy at the end of February. But it still represents a small portion of our business. It represents low single digit regarding the GMV as well as the revenue., Yes, for the -- Eddie, for the customer type with our cloud computing business, it includes start-ups, it includes enterprises, government, so it's pretty diversified., Yes, regarding question on mobile GMV as a percentage of total GMV, I think it's hard for us to tell precisely whether it's going to be exceeding 70% in the coming year. But what I could share with you is that when you look at this quarter's mobile GMV, it already accounts for more than half of our total GMV. So that growth on mobile business pretty much exceeds everybody's expectations, and that trend is continuing., Yes, Alan, this is Maggie. So in terms of online marketing revenue, the growth rate is much higher than what you see last quarter. The growth is actually coming from the mobile, mobile part of the online marketing revenue. So in the mobile part, you can see that the mobile GMV grow so significantly, so that's the key driver. So going forward, it depends on the mobile GMV and how we improve the mobile monetization, then that could all impact the online marketing revenue growth., Yes, we are not actually disclosing any further granularity, but what I can share is that from all of these traffic and CPC and the conversions, all of these are factors we see pretty encouraging growth., Yes, Alice, all of the efforts we're making and we mentioned last quarter, these are all continued efforts and these are not limited efforts we make. The purpose of all this is to improve user experience, enhance the user engagement, so that process will be a continued process. So we believe that as long as we keep improving the user experience, then the monetization will come. The second question?, Yes, Alice, we don't really separate the Taobao Tmall merchants' revenue contribution, so it's -- because Tmall merchants can also put down ads for P4P and Taobao Marketplace. So yes, we just look at it as a whole, overall one marketplace., Yes, Alex, just to add a little bit to Daniel's. In terms of -- we're talking about PC, the traffic CPC. To us, we really see this PC mobile as one integrated marketplace rather than 2 businesses. Think about how many -- it's about user, right? People, they're surfing PC screen to put the products in their shopping carts and they confirm orders on mobile, that's just become very common. So these 2, I mean, channel to us, they are really serving [indiscernible] of consumers in one marketplace. So for us, overall GMV growth, overall revenue growth, that's what represents the business world, rather than just separately seeing each PC and mobile business., Yes, so in terms of the mobile take rate, I think we remain bullish on mobile monetization in the longer term. We do believe that mobile take rate should approach PC or even higher than PC. The reasons are very simple, 3 things. We see more customers -- we see more consumers from mobile. This you can already tell from MAU growth. So more buyers. And second one is higher engagement. So people comes through the mobile more often, more frequent than they did on PC. And the third one is higher value. That's because we have more data on mobile, the location-based data and buyer behavior data. So that's the reason made us believe that the value generated through the mobile platform could be very significant and could be higher. And eventually, that will drive the mobile monetization, the take rate., Yes, in terms of the GMV, I still remember like 2 years ago when we were asked about GMV growth, we were at around USD 250 billion GMV. And we said that in the next 2 to 3 years' time, we see that number get doubled. Right now, you can tell that we're well on track towards that target. And going forward, we do believe that there is market for more than USD 1 trillion GMV worldwide., Yes, talking about SBC, we stated in the announcement that there are 2 parts included in this SBC. One part is our normal performance on higher grant. The other part is purely, according to the GAAP, we have got to mark certain SBCs mark-to-market. This part relates to the shares award of Ant's Group granted to our employees and the shares AGH grants to Ant's employees. So going forward, I think it's hard to say, because the mark-to-market relates to the valuation of both groups. But what I can share is that this significant part of expenses is noncash and it's not going to dilute any of our share -- shareholdings. And we believe that the dilution of -- coming from this SBC will be still, stay at around 1% going forward. Second question, sorry, I missed the second question., Yes, right, right. Alipay, as you mentioned -- how many percentage, we disclosed in the prospectus that around 78% of our total transaction get paid through Alipay. And in the coming 20-F, we're going to give another update. There's no significant change over that ratio.]",975,962,1937

4,10000.html,"(Q3, 2014)",Abercrombie & Fitch,CEO,True,ANF,Michael Jeffries,"[Thank you Brian and good morning everyone. It is very clear that the young apparel sector in which we operate is going through a period of disruption, and turmoil. In response to that we are making significant changes across many aspects of how we operate as a company. These changes include; first, shifting to a branded organization; second, making major changes in our assortments including faster speed-to-market and lower AUC; third, engaging how we -- changing how we engage with our customer; fourth, introducing new store designs; fifth, aggressively investing in DTC and omni-channel; sixth, closing domestic stores; and seventh, taking well in excess of $200 million of expense out of our model., In light of a very difficult quarter, we must ask ourselves, and I know that many of you ask the same questions, are we making the right changes, are we moving fast enough, will these changes be enough to overcome a very challenging environment. Despite the difficult results for the quarter, we believe the answer to these questions is 'yes,' and I will come back to that in a moment., As you know from our pre-release a few weeks ago, the third quarter proved to be more difficult than expected as the trend weakened across all brands and channels. Store traffic improved in August, but then declined significantly for September and October. Reduced logo business continued to weigh heavily on our results contributing approximately 12 percentage points to our down 10 comp for the quarter with non-logo business comping up slightly., Lower than expected sales were compounded by a lower merchandise margin as our AUR came down in a very promotional environment, and by a strengthening dollar. Continued excellent progress on expense reduction mitigated but was not able to fully offset lower than projected gross margin dollars, resulting in a significant miss to our projected EPS., Within the numbers, however, there were some positives. While comps and tops were very negative, bottoms comped positively for the quarter with denim continuing to do well and our dress business remained very strong., Comps were negative across almost all international markets, but were positive in China and improved from the second quarter. In China, the quarter also marked the opening of our first mall-based A&F store in Chengdu, which is performing strongly and encourages us to believe in the growth potential of both brands in China., Coming back to margin, good progress on AUC, cushioned an element of the AUR decline for the quarter, and we see that benefit continuing through 2015. Well always hard to quantify, weather was very likely a factor in our results in September and October. And as the weather cooled down in November, we saw an improvement in our comps., Cold weather categories performed well throughout November, including the Black Friday weekend with the overall improvement in comps was maintained. However, we expect conditions to remain difficult through the balance of the fourth quarter., Returning to the many changes we are making as a company, we are very pleased to have welcomed Fran Horowitz and Christos Angelides to the company during the quarter. Fran and Christos have been on board for around six weeks but are quickly moving into their new roles, and I share the excitement that is felt across the company about the impact they will have on our business. Fran and Christos will join our next earnings call and provide their perspectives on the opportunities they see for each of our brands in 2015 and beyond., Moving to how we engage with our customer, we have been very pleased with the impact of our new Hollister store fronts and beyond the nearly 60 stores already converted; we plan to convert many more stores during 2015., To date the original 10 test stores continue to comp around 10 percentage points ahead of their control group, and expanding the role out to a much larger group of stores should enable us to see an overall comp benefit in 2015., We also remain pleased with key metrics we are seeing from our marketing initiatives. Across both brands, pan growth in platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter is up over 25% year-over-year and total social engagement during the quarter was more than 4 times greater than last year., In addition according to our social listening tool, Crimson Hexagon, net brand Sinemet is up close to 30% per A&F and are close to 40% for Hollister since the beginning of the year., Going forward, we believe our greatest opportunity remains in improving top of phonometrics specifically brand consideration. While it may take time for our marketing efforts to fully translate to the bottomline, we believe we are getting great traction., In addition, we recently began a Hollister price test in 11 northern UK stores where we have re-ticketed most of the assortment lower with these price reductions to be offset by greater percentage reductions in AUC. We will get a good read on this test during the fourth quarter., As we look to 2015, a number of factors give us confidence that we will see a significant improvement in our comp trend. This includes the abatement and neutralization of the logo headwind as we go through the year. The benefit of the broader role out-of-store front conversions, new pricing strategies in Europe, and continuing to gain traction in our assortment and marketing initiatives particularly as Fran and Christos get fully up to speed in their new roles., In the meantime, we are working hard to sustain a recent improvement in the trends over the balance of the quarter, although we continue to expect a very challenging environment., Now I will hand over to Joan]","[Okay. I believe that we have made real progress in the current assortment that we have in place. I think it's been sequential as we moved through the year. I feel that we have a better fashion, and we are gaining traction in that fashion. I think the challenge we have in fashion is being more aggressive with it and having -- making bigger statements and having stronger points of yield about it. I think the fashion has evolved very nicely. I absolutely believe it will affect comp over time., We clearly have headwind in terms of logo and the biggest factor there is that that will mitigate as we move 2015 and will absolutely affect the comp trend., Beg your pardon., Yes. Absolutely. And we continue obviously to underbuy it., Yes, working very hard on that., Time involved in the price test in the UK, the answer is yes, absolutely if that is successful in the UK, we would absolutely replicate it throughout Europe. We think this is a test that will test us what can happen with all of Europe., Morning Kimberly., Let's talk a little about logo outbreak and delish this conversation because I know there's a lot of conversation there. And there's no disputing that it's been a big headwind for us. But we absolutely believe that de-emphasizing logo is strategically the right thing to do as we listen to our customers changing preferences., We will continue to review our assortment on an ongoing basis to determine the optimal mix of logo by brand, by geography, and by channel. We think that there could be come opportunity as we look at the business that way, we are looking at it in great detail. But the headline is that logo is declining. We are looking to manage our way out of it as efficiently as possible., Color on brand differentiation; I think that we are starting to see more differentiation by brand but not enough. The concept of adding Christos and Fran will really help us in this endeavor. So expect to see more differentiation as we go forward., Good morning Jennifer., Sure. The kids' carve-outs, we are looking at very carefully. We have a great deal of attention being paid to this. We are not seeing increases in the total store business yet. The kids' business is healthy in the stores. We are not producing the volume that we need to be in the reduced square footage in the adult store., So we have a big group of people headed by Joanne as a matter of fact. Looking at this how can we be more productive in the adult space. How can we merchandise that store more intensely. We practically eliminated clearance that's not helped us but we are dedicated to make this work because we think the kids' business in this carve-out strategy makes a huge amount of sense., Kids' business I think is starting to look better and better. I have to say that opening the London kids' store helped us in terms of re-imagining that business in terms of content and marketing. I am very optimistic about the kids' business but we got to make this carve-out strategy work., And we will., I might help a little there. I think in total it's probably down about 15%. It's -- we've ticketed the whole assortment lower, but then we have taken key items with really compelling price points. And that's how we are marketing it. We are marketing it front of store, key items, killer price points. We are doing some targeted geo marketing as well. So we will see., Thank you Tom., Okay, you want me to -- let me try the Black Friday weekend because we were all very engaged., Okay. I didn't see any of you out there. Okay. When we netted all out, the trend was consistent with the rest of November which as we said showed improvement over the third quarter. However the cadence within the week shifted with pro-forward of online from Cyber Monday to Black Friday. That was a big deal. In addition, the channel shift continued with a greater mix to DTC which -- and I have to say that we are well positioned given our investments we have made in DTC, reduce store count and that flexibility that Jonathan's talked about., Interestingly, Black Friday became a big deal in UK this year and we were well positioned to do well. Our regional fulfillment gave us an opportunity to fill demand quickly. But interestingly enough, Black Friday UK store comp was 23%, DTC orders plus 263% for a total of 63%. I think this conversation reinforces the fact that we live in a global society and that's what this business is about today., The average store productivity, yeah, absolutely., Thank you., Hi Marni., You are right., Good morning., Thank you., Good morning., Let me take the top of the question. The answer is we think weather played a factor in the sequential decline from August to September and October. And I don't think it was just Europe, I think it included the US but extreme in Europe. And as we entered November, as I said in the opening comments, our business as the weather got cooler clearly improved. So how much was weather driven, I can't tell you, but there was a weather factor and quite honestly we don't like to talk about weather as a factor in our business but it was there., Thank you., Let us check that figure and we will come back to it.]",933,939,1872
4,10000.html,"(Q3, 2014)",Abercrombie & Fitch,CFO and EVP of Finance,True,ANF,Joanne Crevoiserat,"[Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. To recap third quarter results at a high level, despite a significant sales decline for the quarter and continuing AUR pressure, significant expense reductions meant that our custom currency non-GAAP earnings were approximately inline with last year., Going into more detail, net sales for the quarter were $911 million down 12% to last year. Including direct-to-consumer, total comparable sales were down 10%. Sales during the quarter were below expectations with comp sales in September and October being significantly weaker than August. US comp sales were down 7% while total international comp sales were down 16%., By channel store comp sales were down 14% while direct-to-consumer comp sales were up 8%. The direct-to-consumer channel continued to outperform stores posting positive gains in all brands and all markets. Within the stores channel, continued weak traffic was the primary contributor to the lower sales trend particularly in Europe. But average transaction value was also down, driven by lower average unit retail., Within the DTC segment, an increase in conversion rate was partially offset by a decrease in average transaction value., By brand, the comp sales including direct-to-consumer were down 6% for Abercrombie & Fitch, down 10% for abercrombie kids, and down 12% for Hollister, which is disproportionately weighed by European comp sales., Comp sales by gender were approximately in line. In addition weakness in tops, particularly fleece and male graphic tees, more than offset positive trends in jeans and dresses., Changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago also adversely impacted sales by approximately $8 million which was greater than anticipated., The gross profit rate for the quarter was 62.2%, 80 basis points lower than last year primarily reflecting lower international AUR and increased shipping promotion in the direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by lower average unit cost., Excluding pretax charges of $20 million this year and $96 million last year which are details on page 4 of our investor presentation and primarily consists of asset impairment in Gilly Hicks restructuring charges. Adjusted non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $515 million down $85 million or 14% from last year representing 160 basis points of leverage., Expense savings were significantly greater than anticipated coming into the quarter due to continued tight expense management and the realization of significant expense savings on lower sales. And on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, stores and distribution expense for the quarter was $411 million down $69 million from last year representing 140 basis points of leverage. The decreased expense was driven primarily by savings in store payroll and other controllable store expenses which was partially offset by higher direct-to-consumer expense., On an adjusted non-GAAP basis marketing, general, and administrative expense for the quarter was $104 million, down $16 million or 13% from last year. The decline in MG&A expense was primarily due to a decrease in compensation related expense, including incentive and equity compensation expense partially offset by an increase in marketing expense., Other operating income was $2 million for the quarter, compared to $10 million last year which included a $6 million benefit associated with insurance recovery. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis operating income for the quarter was $54 million compared to $60 million last year. And operating margin was 5.9%, flat to last year., The effective tax rate for the quarter excluding the effect of charges was 36.7% versus 31.1% last year which included a benefit of $5 million related to certain discrete tax matters., The tax rate for the quarter was higher than anticipated reflecting a lower proportion of earnings being generated from international operation than previously expected., For the quarter, the company reported adjusted non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.42 compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.52 last year., Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $321 million in cash and cash equivalent and borrowings outstanding of $300 million. Including amounts which could be drawn under our asset-based revolving credit facility, we ended the quarter with total liquidity in excess of $670 million., We also ended the quarter with total inventory at cost down 20% versus last year consistent with our expectation and reflecting improved inventory management., We expect inventory at cost on a year-over-year basis to continue to be down at the end of the fourth quarter., During the quarter we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $75 million. This brings our total year-to-date repurchases to approximately 7.3 million shares., As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately 9 million shares remaining available for repurchase under our previously announced back repurchase authorizations., During the quarter, we closed four US stores and opened seven new stores including two US A&F outlet stores and two international A&F mall-based stores located in China and Germany., At the end of the quarter, we operated 834 stores in the US and 166 stores in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East., And with that I will hand it over to Jonathan.]","[I can pick up the inventory question first. So we are comfortable with our inventory level and the inventory management processes that we have in place. We continue to focus on Chase and fabric platforming giving us the much more flexibility in the supply chain. And so we see inventory levels down -- continuing to be down at the end of the fourth quarter. But at these levels we feel good about our position in terms of being able to get the business. And we do believe our inventory position going into the fourth quarter does give us some opportunity to look for AUR benefit as we move through the quarter. We expect margin to be up in the fourth quarter over last year. That margin improvement is driven by cost decreases. We are not anticipating AUR to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter but our inventory position certainly puts us in a situation where we can look for benefits as we move through the quarter., Hi Neely, it's Joanne. In terms of logo abatement, we do see the headwinds moderating through the spring season, but we still expect headwinds in the spring and the logo headwinds will be largely behind us as we get to the back-half of the year and adversary what we experienced this third quarter. As it relates to the timing of the Europe pricing strategy, we are reading that pricing through the first quarter and certainly depending on the results that we read we expect to more broadly roll that out for back-to-school and in the back half of the year., I will take it off with the AUC comment. The AUC effort is broad based. And we are leveraging the work we are doing in AUC to allow us to make specific investments in retail where we think we are going to get a return. So the AUC efforts are definitely broad based. In terms of the pricing quantifying the adjustments, it really varies on a category by category basis. We are studying the competition and managing the pricing at a category down to an item level to understand the elasticity and the response we are seeing to the pricing. I don't have a one number that I can point to on…, The answer to that question is absolutely. We have been working on driving more depth behind our fashion buys. Since we saw the reaction -- the customer reaction through back-to-school, we definitely will have more behind fashion items in the spring. We do think it will be a benefit to sales. And in terms of the online business, we have an extended assortment online. The fashion does sell well online and we continue to look for opportunities to have web exclusive items offered to our customers through the online channel., From your lips to God's ears., On the question on AUR in Europe, we are investing in price in Europe, but we do expect average unit costs to come down to maintain our margins in Europe. So, we expect to maintain that spread to -- in terms of four-wall margin in our international business versus our US business., And in terms of the comps for Hollister, the spread to A&F is one way, we measure the Hollister business and the spread that A&F in US was about half of what it was in the international business. So we do attribute a large portion of the Hollister difficulty to the European market and the European business., Yes, we are continuing to make progress in speed-to-market, the two initiatives that we have spoken to that are meaningfully moving the needle there or both fabric platforming and our Chase process. And we are on target. We have -- Chase in the female business is between 10% to 20% today, we do expect to double that in the spring season. So we expect to continue to make improvements. On the amount of Chase that we have dedicated in our assortments and our open-to-buy, it is a bigger piece of the female business right now, a smaller piece in male, but we expect a male to also increase in penetration as we move into 2015. And fabric platforming continues to be a focus. We are getting tremendous support from our vendor base, they have been terrific partners with us with both Chase and fabric platforming. And both -- we are platforming fabric across multiple categories and multiple fabrics but we expect to increase that as we move into 2015 as well., $9 million., Average unit cost is definitely something that has been a focus of ours through 2014 and into 2015. Fabric platforming is definitely an element of that. And certainly the ability to have more flexibility closer in gives us an opportunity to avoid markdowns and get the product right. But we continue to work with our suppliers and look for averaging our cost reductions and believe we have made progress with 2014 and believe there's more there in 2015.]",791,827,1618
4,10000.html,"(Q3, 2014)",Abercrombie & Fitch,COO,True,ANF,Jonathan Ramsden,"[Thanks Joanne and good morning everyone. I am going to start with an update on some of our strategic initiatives, and will then give an -- provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year., As Mike mentioned, we are disappointed with our results for the third quarter. While we have expected better topline performance, it is obvious that we remain in a challenging environment. And this underscores the importance of our initiatives to position the company for improved performance., As you know, these efforts are oriented around four key drivers. First, improving productivity and profitability in our US stores through our initiatives around our assortment, marketing and brand engagement, continued closure of underperforming stores, and through opening more outlet stores., As Mike said, we remain pleased with the results in the new Hollister store fronts and expect an accelerated rollout in both the US and Europe in 2015. Our outlet business is also performing well. US outlet stores, comparable sales were up approximately 10% for the quarter and our new MFO outlet stores are performing well., Regarding store closures, we still expect to close approximately 60 stores during 2014 bringing our key listed US closures to around 280 stores excluding Gilly Hicks. We anticipate a similar number of closures in each over the next few years but retain significant flexibility given our lease exploration built-out., Second, continuing to invest in DTC normal channel. We continued the rollout of our omni-channel efforts during the quarter. Ship-from-store is now live in about 370 US schools and order-in-store live in 660 US stores. We expect these initiatives to be sales and margin accretive and we expect to have reservance to our in-store pick-up activated during 2015. We are also working on expanding omni-channel capabilities into Europe., During the quarter we launched localized e-commerce capabilities in Asia, including local desktop and mobile sites in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. Regional fulfillment from Hong Kong and local fulfillment in China and Hollister store front on Qiemo., It is still early days that we have seen a clear improvement in both conversion and traffic, and did particularly well on Singles' Day in China. We also remain on track with a $50 million conversion of one of our distribution centers here in New Albany to be a dedicated direct-to-consumer facility, solid continuing profitable and high return international expansion., As Mike mentioned we are pleased with our performance in China including our first A&F mall-based store in Chengdu. We are also exited by other initiatives to grow the international penetration of our brands including our first franchise arrangement in Mexico which encompasses both the A&F and Hollister brands and where our first store is set to open in late spring 2015., Fourth, lowering expenses. We continue to exceed our goals from savings from the profit improvement initiatives and our next steps include ensuring that process changes implemented during 2014 or institutionalized and continuing to drive for more efficiency in our core processes., Moving on to our earnings outlook for the rest of 2014, we now expect full year non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.55. The guidance is based on the assumption that full quarter comparable sales will be down by a mid to high single-digit percentage. The guidance assumes a gross margin rate for the fourth quarter that is higher than last year but lower than a year-to-date rate., On a sequential basis fourth quarter expense savings will be lower as we anniversary $25 million in savings realized from the profit-improvement initiatives last year., In addition, there were significant savings realized in the third quarter largely related to compensation while will not repeat in the fourth quarter. The guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate in the upper mid 30s which now reflects a lower proportion revenue being generated in international than previously expected., The guidance assumes a fully weighted average share count of approximately 73.1 million shares. The guidance does not include charges related to the Gilly Hicks restructuring, the company's profit improvement initiative, certain corporate governance matters or other potential impairment and store closing charges., Looking to 2015, our single highest priority is improving the comparable sales trend of our business and we are confident with the step we have outlined including the shift to branded organizational model, good season that the company's needed for each of our brands, will enable us to do that., This concludes our prepared comments and we will now be happy to take your questions. Thank you.]","[Good morning Janet., , It's -- we are in a transition period. I don't have to say this and we are not used to selling fashion as well as we are. So we have to give people more confidence., Thank you Janet., Hey Kimberly, I will say those -- I think there are really three things going on there. First of all e-comm is obviously dealing with the same overall impact of logo and the general trend of the business. I think we have historically said we did expect the e-commerce margin to moderate over time. One of the factors in that is shipping and handling revenue as a percentage of e-commerce sales continuing to decline and we do foresee that continuing. On top of that we do have some discreet investments during the period including some startup costs in Asia and some other things we are doing to improve the functionality of the websites including mobile capabilities which were investments through the P&L during the quarter which we expect to benefit from going forward., But the biggest factors were I think the overall trend of the business including the logo impact and then the shipping and handling revenues. That all said we do expect e-comm margin -- channel margin for the year to be below to mid 30s., Yeah., Yeah, on FX related to the international channel, I mean I think the impact that is primarily on our reported results short-term because the value of those sales are getting broad-packed to US dollar reporting is lower because of the stronger dollar in that the dollar did obviously lie significantly after our last earnings call. So that affected the earnings we reported for the quarter. I don't know the immediate impact in terms of the local currency sales is all that significant generally we're priced against the mall locally., I think your second part of the question is, is it, if I am understanding it correctly, not related to FX but just a broader question of bad international expansion given the current environment. I think a couple of points on that. First of all we remain very pleased with what we are seeing in China. We referenced that our comps improved there from the second quarter and we are positive. We are also seeing strong DTC pickup resulting from the increased store presence we have in China. So we think the return on that investment is still very strong. And now we remain the primary filter through which we evaluate international expansion that we believe the ROI based on what we believe to be conservative per sustainable volume assumptions including the impact of the store business on DTC or that continued investment. But certainly based on what we are seeing in China currently, we continue to believe there is significant opportunity in particular., As we discussed in the prepared remarks, we are doing our first franchising rollout in Mexico. That's obviously a very low capital intensive option. So we are also interested to see how that performs and how that might inform our international strategy going forward., I think as we said in the prepared remarks, our plan is to offset it by a greater percentage reduction in AUC. So gross margin rate hopefully is flat to higher and then if there's lower (inaudible) drive unit pickup hopefully gross margin dollars are greater in total. And frankly if they are not, then obviously we wouldn't be rolling out that pricing to Europe more broadly., Good morning. Hi Matt., Taking the first part of the question Matt, I think the impact of year-to-year closing on the comps seems to be relatively insignificant. We were closing 50, 60 stores a year. Typically low-volume stores. We do see a little bit of transfer. Those stores probably have historically comps a little lower than the rest of the chain but not to a big-enough degree that makes a significant impact., I think the important point for us as we think about the range of store performance is the flexibility we have as a result of still a very high proportion of that fleet coming up for renewal in the US over the next two or three years. Clearly there's a very significant channel shift that is continuing towards online that set the higher (inaudible) of that store continued to perform very well. So I think the question for us is really about that middle group of stores that historically did pretty well but are now underperforming and whether we can improve the performance of those stores over the next couple of years with all the initiatives we are undertaking to want to keep them open lot longer term., If I may say that's all I think is -- it is a great question because I think we -- as we told about earlier on, we are getting very good metrics on brand engagement, brand sentiment. But our big opportunity really is to drive brand consideration, i.e., getting new customers or lapsed customers back into our stores and we think, marketing around these AUR efforts as well as we are using the new converted store fronts as we also roll us out into Europe is a great opportunity to really reach a new cohort of customers., Thank you., Coming to the other part of your question about international stores. Yeah, the margin erosion you are seeing there is primarily driven by the de-leverage on the negative comps as well as the point Joanne referenced about the international AUR coming down. We did have some fairly significant profit improvement initiative expense savings that have offset that., So clearly that margin rate has come down, but it's still on a full-year basis got to be we think at a pretty healthy place, but it does underscore the importance of stabilizing our comps in Europe and hopefully improving them over time to sustain margins which at this point remain healthy and certainly much healthier than the US slower margins., Yes., Thank you., Hi Marni., Let me start with the bottom and then we will work our way up. In denim it was fashion and core. Looks good at the top of your question list, can we put some muscle behind the fashion. And now I am going to turn this over to Joanne., The non-logo business in Europe is performing. I think it's difficult to say where we are adjusting the mix in total because it's different by channel, by geography, by brand. But we are making adjustments, some up some down, but it's not significant., On the other part of your question Anna, the great majority of our stores in Europe continue to operate at healthy full margin rate, so the majority are in the north of 20%. We have a very small number of cash flow negative stores in Europe and literally less than a handful. So there are a couple of those that we will contemplate closing. But at this point we do not foresee a significant reduction in our real estate footprint in Europe. That all said, we do have significant release flexibility also in Europe because of some of the provisions we have built into our leases as we expanded into Europe. But at this point we don't foresee -- expecting to use them., So just starting with the omni-channels we said in the prepared remarks, we have order in-store live in 660 US stores, ship-from-store live in 370 stores that really only one live in the last few weeks. So frankly it's too early to give a meaningful read on it. But we are seeing those are nice week to week builds as that starts to ramp up. I think we will certainly have a much clearer view on that by the time we get to the February earnings call., Thank you., Good morning., On the profit improvement initiative Lindsay, we are now well north of $200 million and identified annualized savings. Some of that will flow through, it's already identified for 2015. I think the more important point though is that we not done, we need to continue to find efficiencies in our model going forward, and we certainly think there is ongoing opportunity. So that's going to remain a focus., I think it's a little early to say. Frankly it's going to depend on lots of other assumptions that will roll into our budget when we get to February and talk about our guidance for '15. So I think at this point we -- there's not a whole lot we can add to that., Thank you., So I will take the first part. And -- yes, so reserve in-store pickup we do expect to have activated in 2015 and it will likely be in the back-half of the year, Dorothy, to your question., I think it was about $9 million., Thank you.]",746,1484,2230
