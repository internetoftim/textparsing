Maybe give us a sense on what we expect from these new restructuring goals? And I guess, the second question is related to mobile GMV.

The second question is about the Taobao versus Tmall. So this quarter, the growth rate is very, very different.

As I think about your business historically, merchants have been willing to pay a certain percentage for the access to customers and an ability to actually conduct commerce on the site, and that rate on the desktop historically has been higher than on mobile.
