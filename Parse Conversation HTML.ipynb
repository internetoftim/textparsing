Last month FHACT received conditional license from --licensure from the New York State Department of Health. We think this is an important milestone since it allows the company now to market the test to women's health centers, gynecologists and oncologists throughout the State of New York, which represents more than 7.6 million women. While cervical cancer screening protocols are relatively well established there remain significant unmet need to supplement current screening methods which are live [ph] and subject to cytological examination or just mapping the presence of the HPV virus. \n",

In addition, we expect data later this year from a stack-related [ph] study that we just finalized with the National Cancer Institute in over 300 [ph] patients.

We think that's very muted in the U.S. and but there are other providers, not immunologists [ph] to offer something unique in the marketplace. So we think same variation with solid tumor Hotspot panel. In India the timing is very important, number one, to access the market there. The five tumors conditions are the vast majority and are we bringing the right portfolio for the right geography also.

So we really are believers in disease specific cancer knowledge basis. So we are in the process of launching not only one for surgical but for CLL and B-cell cancers and also for the tumor Hotspot in India.

They don’t have the comprehensive lab capabilities, often times insurers and third party groups will not pay for what perceive to be as the high end of the test, especially if it’s not already in the guideline unless you already have done a test using traditional technology or methodologies that are widely accepted, regardless of how accurate or how specific they are. \n",

In both those cases we’re in a great position because we can reflux right now in our lab and we can demonstrate through the clinical history of that test, that the test A was a clear suggestion to then do Test B. That really helps us significantly and what we’re finding from feedback from payers that our new Head of Vendors [ph] that Dr. Randy Goodman [ph] has been leading is that comprehensive capability of having the entire disease focused library at one site is a massive win for us. \n",

I think almost every conversation that I have with academic research groups about lack of adequate -- line information and the profile of patients we have had. I was at Mayo last week, to discuss that in length, we discussed in terms of how it will impact, how we do variant cause and how we potentially can gather germ line [ph] to our observed germ line materials at the same time, it’s impacting the entire industry. I think we can definitely not stick our head in the sand say we are going to come with the bio-informatic driven solution. And we have to aware that germ line and schematics, remove the tumor from the DNA -- remove the DNA from the tumor itself is very important and it is something that our team has brought up several years back and that had let us to have vision of bringing the two pieces together. \n",

Now for us it’s not only having the capabilities of doing both and having data based capabilities but also for us because we have targeted panels for disease specific we actually tune these panels to be more focused on that disease category so changes for us reporting out germ line variance is minimized. And that’s also an important -- what I think about it is truly a knowledge base driven approach. \n",

       "[u\"Thank you Brian. Good morning to all of you today on the call. Thank you for joining us and taking the time to listen and participate in our first quarter 2015 conference call. For 2015, we're off to a very strong start this year and I am pleased to have the opportunity to take you through some of our operational and financial results for the first quarter.\",\n",
       " u\"The momentum that our business gained in 2014 is continuing to accelerate as we build progress in 2015. The investments that we've made in our genomic portfolio and our acquisitions and our world class collaborations are generating strong results and an increase in our market share and we also making an overall positive impact in the oncology industry and oncology patients.\",\n",
       " u\"This morning we will update you on our financial results for the first quarter and also on how we're successfully executing on strategic initiatives we laid out on our year end call in March. Following this we'll turn it over to questions and answers.\",\n",
       " u\"You've heard me say before Cancer Genetics is an emerging leader in providing critical genomic and biomarker information for the personalization of oncology treatment. We offer our proprietary, disease focused and clinical validated genomic tests and services to clinical centers, hospitals, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and research organizations. We have a unique and unparalleled global infrastructure for the development and delivery of oncology diagnostics from bench to bed side through our four state-of-the-art facilities in New Jersey, North Carolina, India and China.\",\n",
       " u'Our research collaborations with 18 leading academic and research centers, including Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering, The National Cancer Institute, Columbia University, Moffitt Cancer Center and Beth Israel, among many others allows us to access innovation in oncology and genomics, rapidly validates our insights and tests and have unique access to translational oncology programs. We think these collaborations are a true stamp of differentiation and an element of our long term durability as a company.',\n",
       " u'An excellent example of this is our most recent research collaboration with the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. A series of collaborative studies where diagnostic researcher doctors Heather Jim, Diane Portman, Hailey McCloud and Gillian Bell [ph] will examine a number of genetic variance as predictors for the most common side effects associated with chemotherapy treatment which continues to be one of the most broadly used treatments in cancer.',\n",
       " u'Our second collaboration will examine the world of individual genetic variance and effectiveness of pain control in cancer. Results from this partnership and with other leading cancer research organizations will help guide the development of treatment options and provide critical and validated genomic information that improves patient management and reduces healthcare cost.',\n",
       " u'Beyond impact of research collaborations that will drive future tests and revenue, we have made significant progress in a number of key other areas as we advance our goal of leveraging our market leading molecular oncology capabilities and our global footprint to become the premier partner for personalizing oncology diagnostics from bench to bed side.',\n",
       " u'Earlier I referenced the strong market momentum we continue to see in our business as evidenced by our 206% year-over-year growth and an increase in our contracted revenue with bio pharma customers which is now increased to over 30 million. While Ed will discuss the financial details in greater detail later in this call let me provide you with some key highlights of the trends and results from the first quarter.',\n",
       " u'Importantly our 2014 acquisitions and the synergies we are experiencing from these acquisitions continue to meaningfully contribute to our growth and market penetration. Our new locations in North Carolina and India are driving an increasing number of clinical trials who have been selected to power and provide testing services for, that number\\u2019s now well over 70 and we are increasing the number of cross-selling opportunities with some at our largest biopharma customers.',\n",
       " u'In addition, with the additional locations and capabilities we are now running larger size clinical trials, some of which are now spanning multiple laboratory locations. We are very excited about the level of integration we have achieved in the past few quarters and expect this will provide unique value to our customers and to our shareholders. Our infrastructure coupled with the integrated products and portfolio we continue to develop and update and that our customers are rapidly adopting are providing us the backbone to be the leader on oncology diagnostic.',\n",
       " u'Taking a closer look at some of the first quarter financial results, our first quarter year-over-year revenue increased 206% or $3 million to $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This is up sharply from $1.4 million for the three months ending March 31, 2014. Of significance our biopharma service business increased 578% or $2.8 million to $3.2 million in the first quarter of this year and that was up from $491,000 in the same period for 2013.',\n",
       " u'We also improved our gross profit margin significantly year-over-year from 9.8% in 2014 to 28.1% for the first quarter of this year. The majority of this improvement came from improved use of our lab and our staff and better capacity utilization but also improvements to our workflow as we expand our biopharma business and focus our clinical business on more profitable ordering sites. We expect that we will continue to see ongoing gross margin improvements throughout the quarters.',\n",
       " u'A financial metric that is particularly important to note is our overall operating loss which year-over-year changed only 5% while our revenues increased by over 200%. [indiscernible] at this metric because over 90% of our gross profit margin dropped to our operating income. We think this is an important metric and demonstrates both the potential leverage of the business and the rapid progress we have made with the acquired teams.',\n",
       " u'While I am pleased with the momentum and significantly positive trends and results we are seeing in our business I would like to spend a little time discussing some of the key 2015 strategic initiatives and the progress that we are making in a number of important areas.',\n",
       " u'First, with respect to our growing NGS portfolio we are continuing to build a dominant position in the area of hematological malignancies or blood bone cancers with offerings in CRL and myeloid cancer having launched and future launches in multiple myeloma and lymphoid cancer expected for later this year. We have also launched a major driver of growth for us in the India market, our focus Hotspot panel for solid tumors, which targets the five most common solid tumors.',\n",
       " u'Our most recent launch Focus::Myeloid, helps clinicians and cancer centers improve the management and treatment of more than 275,000 patients in the U.S. that are currently living with myeloid malignancies. In addition, over a 100 clinical studies are been conducted by biotech and biopharma companies for compounds targeting myeloid cancers and many of these trials can potentially benefit from CGI\\u2019s Focus::Myeloid panel. Focus::Myeloid provides information to improve enrollment, stratification and treatment monitoring for these complex myeloid malignancies.',\n",
       " u'As you know we are actively developing a pipeline of NGS panels targeting a variety of other cancers as well, including hematologic and solid tumors through our internal innovation efforts. In addition, CGI expects to launch NGS panels that are currently in development through Oncospire Genomics, our joint venture with Mayo Clinic. The first of which is multiple myeloma which will be coming out later this year.',\n",
       " u'Our dominant position in hematologic cancer is contributing to our strong growth and contracted revenue expectations from the biopharma and biotech companies. This number increased to $30 million as of the end of the first quarter and in addition we also recently launched an NGS based panel targeting five most common solid tumors for the Indian and broader Asian markets. This NGS panel can be applied to over 370,000 patients in India alone and as a result of this launch we have seen significant uptick in the order volume, revenue and contract discussions with both clinical and research customers.',\n",
       " u\"Another key initiative for 2015 is increasing market penetration for our blockbuster genomic technology for HPV-related and surgical cancer testing, FHACT. Last month FHACT received conditional license from --licensure from the New York State Department of Health. We think this is an important milestone since it allows the company now to market the test to women's health centers, gynecologists and oncologists throughout the State of New York, which represents more than 7.6 million women. While cervical cancer screening protocols are relatively well established there remain significant unmet need to supplement current screening methods which are live [ph] and subject to cytological examination or just mapping the presence of the HPV virus.\",\n",
       " u\"We think that with our test we can not only better detect HPV ovarian cancers earlier but also predict progression to advance disease. CGI's stock test which assesses genomic changes, common [indiscernible] cervical cancer identified women that are at high risk of the disease. In addition, we expect data later this year from a stack-related [ph] study that we just finalized with the National Cancer Institute in over 300 [ph] patients. We also expect a number of publications focused on FHACT and the launch of a multisite health economic study that will demonstrate the economic value and positive patient outcomes related to FHACT.\",\n",
       " u\"In a critical area of billing and reimbursement, clinical reimbursement we continue to make steady progress. We recently signed an agreement with America's Choice provider network and an independent national network of healthcare providers, which allows us access to over 1,100 out of network payers and allows our diagnostic services to be available to more than 19 million domestic members. I'm very excited about the progress our team has delivered and continues to deliver and where our business is growing today. We believe it's heading -- we really believe it's heading in terms of not only its growth but its impact on patients and the ability to be a true partner for the broader oncology community.\",\n",
       " u'We have a broad portfolio of innovative industry leading products with a number of others on the way, a number of key strategic initiatives that will actually broaden our reach and accelerate our growth in both the clinical and biopharma community, I\\u2019ll touch on some of those later in the call. And we continue to demonstrate solid market penetration and market adoption, all of which has caused [ph] revenue expansion in our growth going forward.',\n",
       " u\"At this point, I'll hand over the call to our CFO, Ed Sitar for a review of our first quarter and our -- first quarter 2015 financial results Ed?\",\n",
       " u'Thank you, Ed. We had a number of value enhancing accomplishments just in the first several months of this year and we expect this to continue driving value for us and our shareholders throughout the rest of 2015. We\\u2019ll walk through some of those before we turn to Q&A.',\n",
       " u'First our focus on reimbursement; we\\u2019ve been actively working with payers and insurance companies in a very disciplined manner, since revamping our clinical revenue cycle team and we expect to make several updates on coverage and network decisions as the year progresses. Second, additional new developments and commercial partnerships; we\\u2019re working on number of commercial partnerships that will increase our proprietary programs, getting in to the marketplace, delivering our suite of services to a greater variety of customers and driving uptick in patient volume. Therefore we think these are very important channel and commercial partnerships that will drive continued growth of our business.',\n",
       " u'Additional product launches is our third, beyond the product launches I touched on earlier we also expect the very first panel through our 50-50 joint venture with the Mayo Clinic, OncoSpire Genomics in multiple myeloma to launch second half of this year. We are on track to developing a very unique panel for the diagnosis and management of multiple myeloma patients. We\\u2019re also on track for an accelerated launch of our first targeted test for lung cancer which no other group currently has in the marketplace.',\n",
       " u'We also expect further market penetration for FHACT. The recent conditional licensure from New York State Department of Health is a positive step toward accomplishing this objective. We\\u2019ve also retooled ourselves on our clinical sales team to really address this market that has over 2 million tests alone annually that can be improved for the outcome of women. As I said in our March call we\\u2019ll continue bringing those women health centers and laboratories into trails and migrating them to routine ordering sites as the year progresses.',\n",
       " u'Fifth, further expanding upon our innovation we see a crucial element to accelerating on our growth. We\\u2019ve number of initiatives to make our company more relevant in emerging areas of oncology, namely in neuro-oncology bringing together schematic and germ-line testing for patients in clinical trials, providing testing for hereditary cancers and developing targeted knowledge base in a number of cancers where CGI has unique insight, unique access and knowledge about the disease.',\n",
       " u'We think these four areas will continue to allow us to access a wider place in the market, drive further growth and make us a more valuable partner in delivering oncology diagnostics from bench to bed side. With that I would like to now open the line for questions.']"

      "                  A key reason for this strong GMV growth is the continued growth in active buyers across our platforms, driven by the increased reach of our mobile commerce apps to users across China and our successful execution in converting users to buyers. An active buyer is someone who came to our retail marketplaces to make at least one purchase during the period of measurement. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, our annual active buyers increased to 350 million, compared to 255 million in the 12 months ended March 31, 2014. This growth represents an increase of 37% year-on-year.\n",

In March this year, we achieved 289 million monthly active users on our mobile commerce apps, which is a net increase of 24 million monthly active users from December and a 77% year-on-year increase from the 163 million reported in March last year. The strength in mobile commerce demonstrates our ability to attract mobile users with strong commercial intent on a scale that we believe is unrivaled by any of our peers in China or globally.\n",

It is very important to note that mobile GMV now accounts for 51% of total GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces in this quarter, compared to 42% in the prior quarter and 27% for the quarter ended March last year. Maggie will address the financials in more detail in her comments, but our overall revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, increased by 45% year-on-year.\n",

Mobile revenues in the current quarter now make up 40% of our China commerce retail revenue, compared to 12% in the same quarter last year. With increasing mobile GMV and mobile revenue, we're executing well against our strategy of aggressively transitioning existing users and acquiring new users to our mobile platform as well as increasing monetization of the mobile interface at a steady pace.\n",

Revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB 17.4 billion. Non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 49%, down from 57% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income grew 16% year-over-year to RMB 7.7 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS, excluding SBC and amortization of intangible assets and certain other items, was RMB 3, an increase of 7% compared to RMB 2.8 in the same quarter of 2014.\n",

Our mobile monetization rate has continued to improve, from 0.98% in March quarter last year to 1.73% this quarter. However, please note that we implemented certain measures in the year-ago quarter that artificially constrained mobile monetization rate in order to ensure user experience, so this quarter's mobile monetization rate has a relatively easy comparison to our March quarter 2014. Starting mid-June quarter 2014, we began to phase out these measures.\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "                  Going forward, we expect improvement in mobile monetization to be driven by our ability to deliver more value to customers. Remember, improvement in mobile monetization may not always be linear, given seasonality and other factors that change each quarter. But we continue to strongly believe that the long-term trend in mobile monetization is positive.\n",

      "<p>\n",
      "                  Year-on-year, our revenue grew 45% to RMB 17 billion, primarily driven by an increase in new active buyers. Both Taobao and Tmall GMV grew very well this quarter. However, Taobao GMV year-on-year growth was disproportionately impacted by the late timing of Chinese New Year holiday, while Tmall was not impacted as much due to special holiday promotions.\n",

The restructuring of our relationship with Ant Financial was completed in early February 2015. This had 2 impacts on the other revenue, a loss of interest income generated from the SME loan business and the addition of new income from Ant Financial equal to 2.5% of the average daily balance of SME loans pursuant to our agreement with Ant Financial. As I noted last quarter, this restructuring has a net income neutral impact on our financials. The decrease in revenue related to the SME loan business was offset by a decrease in expense related to the -- managing the loan portfolio.\n",

Our full fiscal year 2015 non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 53.5%, versus 58.5% in full fiscal year 2014. The decrease in non-GAAP EBITDA margin was due primarily to the consolidation of acquired business, mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi, and also to investments in new business initiatives, such as cloud computing, digital entertainment, mobile operating system and local services.\n",

This amount was less than 20% of our free cash flow in fiscal year 2015. We believe that our non-GAAP EBITDA margin in the high-50s in our core commerce business will remain stable going forward.\n",

Non-GAAP product development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased year-over-year, as we stopped paying royalty fees to Yahoo! after our IPO in mid-September. Excluding that factor, non-GAAP product development expense, non-GAAP sales marketing and non-GAAP G&amp;A all increased due to the investments mentioned above.\n",

So it's a unified platform. In terms of take rate, I would say, today, more and more stuff and more and more sellers, they get used to do business on mobile because they observe that consumers shift from PC to mobile. So they are doing business on mobile and they start spending money on mobile to promote their storefront and items. And if you look at our take rate on the PC side, I will say, actually, the marketing revenue on the PC side in terms of the CPC and the click-through rate, and the spending actually still increased this quarter, offset by the increase in the commission revenue in this quarter. Because actually, in this quarter, we promote -- we had a quite good promotion in Tmall in the Chinese New Year and in March. So this is a upside.

So my question is, should we understand that this management change or restructuring in the group is pretty much done and we should see some positive change in the business starting from second quarter? That's my first question. The second question is a housekeeping question about your lottery business. It's been ceased in March month. How much of an impact that is on your GMV in March?

This is really -- I mean, Alibaba is always very good at continuously developing and improving the management of our company. And I think with the CEO transition of Daniel, we have also brought in some younger folks to run some of the core businesses like Tmall. As you know, Jeff Zhang who was running Taobao Marketplace is now running both Tmall, Taobao Marketplace and also Juhuasuan, so he has all the e-commerce marketplaces underneath him. We also have some other terrific executives in other leadership positions, in B2B, in cloud computing. In the case of the Alimama marketing platform, we, through the acquisition of UCWeb, we were able to brought on board a very strong executive in Yu Yongfu, and he has proven over the months of integration, to bring a lot of value to and insight to our business. And so we decided that it was appropriate and the right time for him to take over the Alimama business. But this is a process that we are continuously undergoing. We always are looking for talented, young executives to take on more responsibility.

Recently, Ministry of Commerce proposed to require all online merchants to have business registration and operating licenses. So I'm just curious, would that affect the individual sellers on Taobao? I'm not too concerned on Tmall, but more on Taobao. And separately, another question is about your cloud computing initiative. Just wondering if Daniel could provide a bit more color in that business. For example, what would be the key customer industries you have right now, the key service that they are using?

I think, overall, it looks, it appears your business units are under a lot of restructuring and were verticalizing, meaning our 3 business unit is now doing a lot more deeper things and restructuring. Can you help us to understand the key objectives of some of these key BUs? We notice that Juhuasuan and Tmall, a lot of the big brands are -- we are encouraging them to come into that platform. Maybe give us a sense on what we expect from these new restructuring goals? And I guess, the second question is related to mobile GMV. I think the conversation of Jeff Zhang to some of the sellers in recent weeks was that GMV from mobile could potentially be 70% by the end of the year.

      "                  Okay, this is Daniel. I will answer the first question. When we look at the restructuring of the team and business, first thing we will think, how to -- in what kind of organization structure is a benefit for the customers. So for example, today, and a lot of Tmall merchants, they are the power seller and they're doing the day-to-day operation on Tmall platform, but they need a space to promote or to have a big event for them. So that's what exactly the Juhuasuan can provide. So to put all these Tmall business and Juhuasuan into one head, Jeff Zhang, I think is benefit for the customer and can give customers a one-stop solution in terms of the daily operation and promoting events. And second factor when we consider in the restructuring is that how to leverage our internal resources and improve the operating efficiency. So put all the Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan under one head, actually we can have each of these 3 platforms have a very strong unique position. The head, the BU head, they can -- he can oversee the entire business and to promote SMEs in Taobao and to serve the brand companies, the retailers in Tmall and give the promotion platform in Juhuasuan. So we believe this can help us to improve and grow our efficiency and reduce our internal conflicts.\n",

So when they are coming to a holiday, they will -- because they are, their cash flow is quite tight. A small business always have a relatively tight cash flow, so they will pull back the inventory purchase and the stock to reduce stock to a lower level. But for large sellers in Tmall and they have quite flexible cash management. So that's why in Taobao, a lot of individuals, they will planning [ph] their stock during the Chinese New Year, and actually before Chinese New Year, until 2 weeks after Chinese New Year.

I'm wondering can you share with us the trend of these 2 metrics since you introduced the mechanism to change the algorithm and encourage the long-tail bidding. And then the path of -- for these 2 metrics to recover and increase on year-over-year basis, should we think about this as a few months' story or a few quarters or a few years? The second question is about the Taobao versus Tmall. So this quarter, the growth rate is very, very different. I think you also mentioned one of the reason is because Tmall had done some events to drive the GMV.

      "                  Okay, for the first question, let me explain again, actually on PC, because more and more merchants they observe that traffic are shifting to mobile, so they start to spend money on mobile and better keywords. So that's why the CPC, cost-per-click, reduced on PC side because of lack of competition. And I tried to correct that. Actually on the PC side, it's not a CTR reduction. It's about because of the traffic shifting, part of the traffic shifting to the mobile side. So actually, the search traffic actually is going flat. So that, we believe, is the reason why we saw a decrease in the marketing revenue on the PC side. And for the second question about the growth of GMV in Tmall versus Taobao. And actually, we don't try to prioritize Tmall or prioritize Taobao. They are equally important to us. For this quarter, actually, why we have 2 promotions for Tmall, one is in Chinese New Year. Because in Tmall, we have partnered with a logistics company, which can help us to deliver the large appliances all across China, even in Chinese New Year. So we encouraged our seller on our platform who sells -- who are selling large appliances and they do the promotion during Chinese New Year. And the second one is the promoting in March. Actually, in March 8, we launched a promotion and which is encouraged consumers to scan the barcode and purchase. The vast majority of the items selected in this promotion is groceries from Tmall, so that's why Tmall enjoyed the benefit in this quarter from the promotion.\n",

People, they're surfing PC screen to put the products in their shopping carts and they confirm orders on mobile, that's just become very common. So these 2, I mean, channel to us, they are really serving [indiscernible] of consumers in one marketplace. So for us, overall GMV growth, overall revenue growth, that's what represents the business world, rather than just separately seeing each PC and mobile business.\n",

      "                  One question. It relates to long-term take rates. As I think about your business historically, merchants have been willing to pay a certain percentage for the access to customers and an ability to actually conduct commerce on the site, and that rate on the desktop historically has been higher than on mobile. And just trying to understand as mobile matures over the long term, is there any reason to think that mobile monetization or take rate shouldn't converge with where the historical desktop take rate has been? Or is there something that's done by merchants in terms of advertising spend that's not tied directly to the transaction that would lead that line of thinking to be inaccurate?\n",

      "                  Yes, so in terms of the mobile take rate, I think we remain bullish on mobile monetization in the longer term. We do believe that mobile take rate should approach PC or even higher than PC. The reasons are very simple, 3 things. We see more customers -- we see more consumers from mobile. This you can already tell from MAU growth. So more buyers. And second one is higher engagement. So people comes through the mobile more often, more frequent than they did on PC. And the third one is higher value. That's because we have more data on mobile, the location-based data and buyer behavior data. So that's the reason made us believe that the value generated through the mobile platform could be very significant and could be higher. And eventually, that will drive the mobile monetization, the take rate.\n",

Maybe if I look out for next couple of quarters, I understand there's some new kind of merchant’s recruitment policies and other customer-related user experience policies implemented. When should we expect the Tmall growth to kind of continue accelerating going into the next couple of quarters? And second question is on the -- more on the O2O and some of the local services initiatives. I wonder if management can discuss more about the -- some of the investment plans and some of the other cooperation with the end-financial side, that will be great.\n",

      "                  Okay. Thank you, Dick. For the first question and -- we adopt, we adjust our recruitment policy in Tmall in early March, and we hired an entry -- we upgraded our entry standards. So the purpose of this is to increase the quality of the merchants. So for when we look at the Tmall operating methodology, we don't try to grow our business by number of merchants. Instead, we try to help our merchants to grow their business to help them to increase their sales -- to enjoy high sales store growth, same-store growth. So we believe that by adopting this new policy and the people will enjoy a better experience because we give them more confidence in the high-quality products. And all the merchants here are high quality, so we believe, ultimately, this should be a benefit for all the merchants here and also benefit for the long-term growth of Tmall. And for the second question, O2O. I would like to say that O2O to me is actually isn't a -- O2O cannot be a unified platform. It's very difficult to be a unified O2O platform because in each business, there is a O2O opportunity. And the online-to-offline business in certain business should be fully integrated. So our strategy is to identify and focus on some of the key areas, key industries and to restructure the business using the Internet -- use the Internet technology and thinking. For example, in the food and catering, in the car booking, and we participate in the travel sector. We, either we do this business by ourselves or we enter this sector by investment.\n",

This part relates to the shares award of Ant's Group granted to our employees and the shares AGH grants to Ant's employees.

This is really -- I mean, Alibaba is always very good at continuously developing and improving the management of our company. And I think with the CEO transition of Daniel, we have also brought in some younger folks to run some of the core businesses like Tmall. As you know, Jeff Zhang who was running Taobao Marketplace is now running both Tmall, Taobao Marketplace and also Juhuasuan, so he has all the e-commerce marketplaces underneath him. We also have some other terrific executives in other leadership positions, in B2B, in cloud computing. In the case of the Alimama marketing platform, we, through the acquisition of UCWeb, we were able to brought on board a very strong executive in Yu Yongfu, and he has proven over the months of integration, to bring a lot of value to and insight to our business. And so we decided that it was appropriate and the right time for him to take over the Alimama business. But this is a process that we are continuously undergoing.

The second thing on user experience is that because of mobile, the collection of data can be more customized, for example, location-based data. That could help us target the users better. And on the seller end, we have recently launched a tool integrated into our mobile Taobao app that enables the sellers to manage the entire storefront through mobile. So they don't even need to own a PC or a notebook computer to manage their storefront. So we would -- we made it very, very easy for them to manage their storefront.

And I think with the CEO transition of Daniel, we have also brought in some younger folks to run some of the core businesses like Tmall. As you know, Jeff Zhang who was running Taobao Marketplace is now running both Tmall, Taobao Marketplace and also Juhuasuan, so he has all the e-commerce marketplaces underneath him. We also have some other terrific executives in other leadership positions, in B2B, in cloud computing. In the case of the Alimama marketing platform, we, through the acquisition of UCWeb, we were able to brought on board a very strong executive in Yu Yongfu, and he has proven over the months of integration, to bring a lot of value to and insight to our business. And so we decided that it was appropriate and the right time for him to take over the Alimama business. But this is a process that we are continuously undergoing. We always are looking for talented, young executives to take on more responsibility. And we're extremely thrilled to have Daniel taking over the leadership of this group with the wholehearted support from management.\",\n",
       " u\"Carlos, on your second question. When a user has a mobile device, the user tends to use it more frequently. So number one, the frequency of purchases go up because mobile is just so convenient. And anytime, anywhere you are, when you think about buying something, especially in sort of impulse items, it's just very easy to get on the mobile and buy something. The second thing on user experience is that because of mobile, the collection of data can be more customized, for example, location-based data. That could help us target the users better. And on the seller end, we have recently launched a tool integrated into our mobile Taobao app that enables the sellers to manage the entire storefront through mobile. So they don't even need to own a PC or a notebook computer to manage their storefront. So we would -- we made it very, very easy for them to manage their storefront. So we're doing all these things to make it easy for both buyers and sellers to transact on the mobile platform.\",\n",
       " u\"Yes, I just want to comment on the -- there's a question on the M&A strategy in -- especially overseas, I just wanted to comment on that. We have -- we're looking at M&A sort of outside of China in 2 types of situations. The first one is we're always looking to invest in minority stakes in companies that we see as having disruptive technology or business ideas. And there, the main purpose is to back entrepreneurs and establish the relationship and learn from these entrepreneurs. So that is one type of category. The other, when we venture out to -- out of China to do something, it is usually with a view toward improving the customer experience that tie back to our core business. So for example, we made an investment in Singapore Post because we are looking at cross-border logistics, making sure that sellers that selling from China to all over the world, especially to Southeast Asia consumers, can have a better experience when it comes to logistics, okay.\"]"
